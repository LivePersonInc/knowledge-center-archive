The holiday season is here and 2020 is nearly behind us!
While we start to slow down and prepare for the New Year, we want to reflect on the past year and take you through the many highlights we’ve seen as a company. 
This year, LivePerson took groundbreaking steps in helping brands manage conversations with customers in an unprecedented time. 

In 2020, over 5 trillion messages were sent through the Conversational Cloud platform.
Watch this two-minute video for the Best of 2020.

### This year we launched…

## The Conversational Cloud

The Conversational Cloud was officially launched and LivePerson renamed many of its products to better reflect their capabilities. For more information on LivePerson’s product architecture, click [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/admin-settings-product-renaming-overview.html)

## Performance Optimizer
LivePerson launched the Performance Optimizer, which is a product within the Conversational Cloud that converges numerous strategic metrics for different Lines of Business into the LivePerson 4E Framework™, driving probability and business growth.
The Performance Optimizer is LivePerson’s first analytical product geared towards C-suite executives, Lines of Business, and organizational decision makers. The Performance Optimizer contextualizes data through anonymized brand comparisons, anonymized industry benchmarks, segmentations, and KPI targets. Narrative-driven dashboards and data contextualization allow managers to diagnose performance opportunities in a faster, more intelligent way.
The Performance Optimizer has a simple graphic interface, requiring no advanced cognitive skills such as complex information processing, data analysis or mathematical skills. This provides users with accurate results, actionable information, and recipes for success.

### In 2020, we placed a lot of importance on automations

We revamped our Conversation Builder tutorials so that our customers can get started with bots and automations quickly and seamlessly without the need for code.
Check out all our Conversation Builder tutorials [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-conversation-builder-getting-started-tutorials.html)

## Conversation Builder dialog editor 2.0
The Conversation Builder Dialog Editor 2.0 was updated to a self-guided interface with no need for code. Dialog Editor 2.0 is a one-stop tool for designing and building scalable conversations with dialogs and interactions across multiple channels. Bot developers can easily develop and maintain hundreds of dialogs and interactions using Dialog Editor 2.0. 
Key improvements include:
* Self-guided interface for easily creating rules, without the need for coding
* Scalable UI for dialog creation and management, with multiple types of interactions, dialog templates and libraries to facilitate building better conversation flow
* Improved UI for configuring user response handling
* Improved overall readability of conversation flow
* Aligned navigation towards the overall Conversational Cloud

## Dialog templates
Dialog templates were built, allowing bot developers to create reusable, high-quality automations. A dialog template is a set of resources that supports a conversational flow and is defined as a unit that can be “imported” by others. When a bot developer imports a single dialog template, the entire unit of working functionality is imported. This includes not only the main dialog that supports the flow, but also all other necessary resources: other dialogs, domains, integrations, and so on.

Once a bot developer imports a dialog template into a destination bot, it becomes a normal dialog within the bot, and the dialog functions as if it had been created from scratch. Dialog templates are a great way to formalize the import process for a dialog, and ensure that bot developers import all required components supporting a dialog.

### Intent-driven business was also a major focus

## Intent discovery and optimization

The Intent Manager was enhanced and the Intent Discovery and Optimization features were launched.
New self-service intent discovery and optimization features enable brands to tune their Intent taxonomy and deploy improved models within minutes. Brands can now easily mine their conversation data to discover and build new intents from one unified interface. They can also correct misclassified messages and feed those annotations back into their model as new training phrases to improve recognition quality.

## Pre-built domains
To get you quickly up and running with Intents, LivePerson now provides a set of prebuilt domains that can easily be added to the Intent Builder environment. A “prebuilt domain” is a ready-made, pretrained domain that includes a set of well-defined intents. No prior conversations are needed to get started (unlike the starter pack).

There are two kinds of prebuilt domains:
1 ) Generic, prebuilt domains for a number of verticals: Telecommunications, Financial Services, Airlines and Insurance.
2) A cross-vertical, prebuilt domain that is appropriate for all verticals. This includes intents for things like customer account management, customer order management, e-commerce, billing and payment.
Once you add a prebuilt domain, you can customize it as you see fit. After customization, you’ll need to retrain the domain as you typically do.

## Messaging Channels 
Proactive Messaging expanded rapidly, exceeding 5 trillion outbound messages sent in 2020.
Proactive Messaging allows brands to send consumers outbound messages via SMS, or through richer channels like WhatsApp, to initiate high value marketing and customer care conversations. Instead of relying on low conversion emails, or one-way messages that direct consumers to web pages or phone calls, Proactive Messaging allows consumers to respond to marketing campaigns and customer care alerts within the same conversation. This results in higher conversion rates, lower operational costs, and rich conversation experiences that increase consumer satisfaction.

For the latest release of Proactive Messaging check out the [Release Notes.](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/release-notes-2020-october-week-of-october-19th.html) For more information on Proactive Messaging and getting started, see the [user guide.](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/messaging-channels-proactive-messaging-proactive-messaging-user-guide.html)

## Instagram
Brands can respond to Instagram DMs, story tags, and comments directly within the Conversational Cloud. It supports structured content including images & quick replies.
This feature is currently available for Early Adopter clients in the Conversational Cloud.

### Agent and Manager Workspace enhancements

## Accessibility
At LivePerson, we believe our products should be accessible to even more diverse populations, which is why  in 2020 we began our journey to Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
In the upcoming deployments, agents and agent managers will be able to use the following accessibility features on both dark and light themes):
* Screen reader
* Keyboard navigation
* Focus outline
* Accessible color contrast 
* Adjustable font size
* Along with other enhancements that make our products usable by as many people as possible.

This applies for Chat, the Enhanced Agent Workspace, and Manager Workspace.

## Agent app
The Agent app was launched for Android and improved for iOS.
The LivePerson Agent app, available for both iOS and Android, allows agents and agent managers to message with consumers on-the-go. This has been extremely helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the more people around the world moved to a remote working model.

### This month we released the following…

## Engagement Enhancements (early access)

Three new types of engagements have been introduced in early access: 

### Multi Channel Engagements 
Enables brands to use website engagements that present multiple channel options (Web Messaging and SMS). Future releases will support combinations with additional channels.

### Web to SMS Engagements
Enables brands to invite consumers to initiate an SMS conversation from a desktop web experience. When clicked, the consumer is presented with a Web to SMS form. Upon form submission, an SMS is sent to the consumer.

### Type-In Engagements: 
Provide a more inviting experience to consumers by enabling the consumer to type in and send their first message directly from the engagement.

We also released some updates to Reporting, including:
Secure Form ( PCI) for messaging Reporting
Brands using Secure Forms in messaging have greater visibility/transparency in payments and are able to measure the ROI. It also allows users to cross examine with other metrics such as CSAT and Conversions, to see how the feature is performing and impacting customer satisfaction and revenue generation.

### Announcements
## Realtime Dashboard for Messaging - End of life pushed to March 2021

Please note that the date of the Real-time Dashboard deprecation has been moved from December 2020 to the end of Q1 2021 to provide additional time to allow business monitoring operations to migrate to the new Manager Workspace. 

The Real-time Dashboard was developed before the new Manager Workspace was introduced. The new Manager Workspace is embedded into the core platform, allowing users to manage their operation seamlessly and in real time, eliminating the need to support the Real-time Dashboard. Note: Chat users will not be affected by this at this time. For more information on the new Manager Workspace, click here.

## Advanced Messaging Dashboard

The Advanced Messaging Dashboard was originally built for critical messaging reporting needs that could not be served elsewhere. All of those reporting needs are now being served by either the Analytics Builder Predefined Dashboards or other reporting tools within Conversational Cloud. The Advanced Messaging Dashboard is undergoing a sunset plan: end of support is March 31st 2021 and end of life is planned for April 30th 2021.
