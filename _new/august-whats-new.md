## Conversational Cloud unveiling 
The LivePerson Conversational Cloud is the evolution of LiveEngage. It’s an AI-powered conversational platform that transforms brands into intent-driven conversational enterprises. Our Conversational AI was built by an expert team of engineers and data scientists, using extensive research and testing together with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. This AI is the heart of the Conversational Cloud — and it’s already transforming sales and customer care for some of the world’s most innovative brands.

The Conversational Cloud makes it possible to understand consumer intents in real-time to inform critical business decisions and automate consumer interactions at scale on all the popular messaging channels. The Conversational Cloud powers the orchestration of human agents, bots, and systems through a specialized set of AI-powered services and tools. Brands can use this platform to discover and understand consumer intents, design and scale personalized automations to fulfill those intents, and measure and optimize the effectiveness of conversations.

## Intent Manager 
In the coming weeks, we have many exciting updates to the Intent Manager.

Advanced filtering options provide customers with increased flexibility and the ability to cover more granular use cases including detailed analysis of bot/human tango. Exclude and compound filter options will make it faster to drill into specific data views.

### Self-service
Users can trial Intent Analyzer, learning more about it and quickly getting started with new domains. For more information, click [here]

### New navigation
Improved menu layout and alignment with Conversational Cloud products

### Semantic search

## Intent Powered Queue prioritization
Brands can configure their customer queuing logic to prioritize specified high value intents. For more information on Queue Prioritization, click [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/contact-center-management-messaging-operations-queue-management-queue-prioritization-overview.html)

## Dialog Templates 
LivePerson are continuing investment in to pre-built, fully functional dialog templates for common intents that help bot developers build high quality conversations. Examples include escalation/frustration models, resolution/completion models, sentiment models (MCS), and improved statement of intent classifiers.

## Pre Built domains
To get you quickly up and running with intents, LivePerson now provides a set of prebuilt domains that can easily be added to the Intent Builder environment. A “prebuilt domain” is a ready-made, pretrained domain that includes a set of well-defined intents. No prior conversations are needed to get started (unlike the starter pack).

There are two kinds of prebuilt domains:
1 ) Generic, prebuilt domains for a number of verticals: Telecommunications, Financial Services, Airlines and Insurance.
2) A cross-vertical, prebuilt domain that is appropriate for all verticals. This includes intents for things like customer account management, customer order management, e-commerce, billing and payment.
Once you add a prebuilt domain, you can customize it as you see fit. After customization, you’ll need to retrain the domain as you normally do.

## Performance Portal
At the core of the portal is a dashboard and enablement framework that clearly articulates how primary and secondary KPIs influence success  and align to the LivePerson 4E Framework (TM) pillars of Efficiency, Effectiveness, Effort, and Emotion

The Performance Portal has anonymized brand comparisons, industry benchmarks, segmentations, and KPI targets.  
A Configuration Engine within the Performance Portal allows brands to define reporting units and save data in relevant segmentations. 

Narrative-driven dashboards and data contextualization allow people to diagnose issues in a faster, more intelligent way.

## Third Party Bots - Conversation Tester
Brands will be able to have mock conversations with their onboarded bot directly from the 3rd Party Bot interface. They will be able to test out the responses of the bot and troubleshoot issues. The Tester will create a conversation with the bot and will present feedback and error messages to the tester allowing Brands to validate their Bot's flows and correct issues. The tester will help establish if intents are missed, if structured content is wrongly set up thereby empowering the Brand to make corrections before taking the bot to their consumers.

## Functions Key/Value Store
This enhancement provides a simple integrated storage that lambdas can use to save customer data.

## Migration to the enhanced workspace September 14th
LivePerson launched the enhanced agent workspace for messaging last year. On September 14th 2020, we will be retiring the old workspace. After that date, the link to revert back to the old workspace will no longer be available.   

Many customers have already moved to the new workspace and are benefiting from its enhancements and new functionalities. We’ve updated the new workspace to the WCAG accessibility standards and this workspace simplifies agent operations and dramatically increases efficiency.

## Window Title Bar - Allow customizations and WCAG support
Brands will be able to customize the text in the Window Title Bar and provide appropriate WCAG support. This is a feature enhancement sub-item of WCAG 2.1 Certification efforts.

## Conversation Orchestrator
### Context Intelligence - SDEs available in Context Warehouse and Routing policies
Brands can use SDEs (Structured Data Entities) to send custom attributes when initiating a conversation from both unauthenticated and authenticated flows. Provides UI tools in the Workspace that allows brands to use SDEs to build complex routing policies without the need to understand coding.

### Dynamic Routing Workspace
LivePerson are improving the UX for large number of attributes and policies.
