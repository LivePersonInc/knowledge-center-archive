Leverage content from a variety of sources (CMS, Google Sheets, and CSVs) to equip agents and bots with time-saving, AI-powered answers to seamlessly respond to consumer questions. KnowledgeAI can automate answers across channels using LivePerson’s Conversational Cloud, giving brands the ability to:
 
* Power bot-to-consumer conversations
* Recommend knowledge answers to agents, increasing their efficiency and availability.

Simply assign the appropriate human agent skills to the knowledge bases in Conversation Assist, and turn on the recommendations setting. If the conversation’s skill is a match to the knowledge base, recommendations from the knowledge base will be served when appropriate.
