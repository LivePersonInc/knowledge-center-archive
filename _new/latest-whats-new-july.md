## MACS Score: A new measure of bot conversation quality
LivePerson is pleased to introduce the Meaningful Automated Conversation Score, or MACS, which is a new way to measure the quality of bot conversations

![](img/new-july-1.png) 

Consumer effort is a key determiner in how the consumer perceives the  conversational experience. Given this, MACS is a score that’s calculated by identifying and quantifying the consumer effort - the conversation quality, consumer sentiment, and failure states - within the bot conversation. Using proprietary LivePerson AI logic, MACS detects issues within the conversation’s structure and derices a score. Issues include:

* Was the consumer stuck in an endless loop?
* Did the bot ignore the consumer’s question? 
* Did the bot understand the consumer’s question?
* Was the bot able to transfer to an agent successfully?

MACS is calculated for each Conversation Builder bot conversation based on these issues. The conversation is classified with MACS 1, 2 or 3 where:

To indicate overall bot performance, an average score is also calculated for each bot based on its conversation scores. MACS helps users speed up NLU system optimization and bot training.

In this initial release of MACS, you can use MACS within the Bot Analytics application to quickly identify underperforming bots and find their failure points. Then, review selected conversations to understand the broken flows and identify the dialogs and interactions to tune.

MACS data is only available within Bot Analytics, but we’re just getting started with MACS. Stay tuned for new ways to work with this powerful, new quality measure.

## Intent Manager 2.2: Unified Navigation, Domain Support & more
Intent Manager 2.2 introduces unified navigation of all Intent Manager components (Intent Builder, Intent Analyzer, AI Annotation) under a shared Intent Manager user interface, as well as some new product enhancements. 

### Unification of all Intent Manager components
In the Conversational AI section, a new Intent Manager button will serve as the single point of entry for all Intent Manager components, including Intent Builder and Intent Analyzer. The Intent Manager unification improves the user experience as navigation is faster and more intuitive.

The update Includes a new Intent Manager homepage where users can view key coverage and quality stats. The new Information Architecture combines the four key elements of Intent Management into one unified navigation experience (Discover, Build, Analyze, Optimize). Navigation between Intent Manager sections (Discover, Build, Optimize, Analyze) is seamless and coherent. For brands that do not have Intent Analyzer enabled Analyze and Discovery features will be “locked”.

### New Intent Manager Dashboard

There is a new Intent Manager Dashboard that provides a high level overview of Domains, Intent Coverage, and Intent Quality. From the dashboard you can control settings and quickly navigate to the Discover, Build, Optimize, and Analyze sections of Intent Manager for each Domain.

## Multi-domain support
Intent Manager 2.2 also introduces multiple intent domain support, making it possible to evaluate each consumer message against multiple machine learning models in real time, with the ability to process and store classifications from multiple Intent Domains simultaneously (up to 5 domains).

* Domains are selected from Intent Manager instead of from Intent Builder. Multi-domain opens the door for brands to:
* Develop and A/B test new domains
* Support more than one language per account
* Support multiple lines of business
* Independently tune models for specific use cases: sales and marketing, churn detection and escalation, social media monitoring, specialized bots and automation
