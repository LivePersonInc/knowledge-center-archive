LivePerson is transforming Conversational Cloud to Public Cloud        
As LivePerson continues to innovate and provide new capabilities that empower brand-to-consumer conversations, we are migrating Conversation Builder to a secure public cloud offering from Google -  Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). 
 
## FAQs
**Note: If you were notified that your account was moving to the GCP Cloud, please carefully review the information below:**

#### Q: Will Brands experience any disruptions during the move?
No. We do not expect any change in the experience for the Brands. The bot enablement on the new environment will be coordinated via an automation script to ensure no message is lost.

#### Do I need to login using a different URL ?
No. We will automatically redirect the Brandsâ€™ users to the appropriate URL. If you have bookmarked deeplinks, we recommend that you update them.  The main login URL does not need to be changed.

#### Will I see any loss in data from a reporting perspective?
During the maintenance window, you will not be able to see historical data but all data will be available immediately after the maintenance window closes which we expect will take approximately 10 hours from start to finish.

#### Are any user experience changes expected for using Bot Builder tools?
No. There are no software updates and this is mainly an infrastructure change to a new environment.
