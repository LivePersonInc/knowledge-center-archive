After careful consideration, LivePerson has decided to **move the Conversational Cloud to a secure, public cloud offering from Google - Google's Cloud Platform (GCP)* in order to expand to a robust global network.

The decision to move to the public cloud was made after weighing customers' needs and the numerous benefits offered by expanding to an established robust global network.
 
 ## Top Benefits:
  * **Faster service** - deployment to more geographic regions that are closer to agents and brands
  * **Increased stability & scalability** - automatic scaling of services better able to accommodate peak times and seasonal events
  * **Increased reporting performance** - more timely access to key metrics
  * **Access to API utilization** - for better planning and developer experience
  * **Faster time to new products** - Exclusive focus on innovation and differentiated features rather than infrastructure maintenance. 
 
## The Process & Implications
**Note: If you were notified that your account was moving to the GCP Cloud, please carefully review the information below:**

As an initial step, the Liveperson Operations team will conduct maintenance on the Conversation Builder platform to begin to move accounts to the GCP public cloud environment.

### No downtime expected & no data will be lost 
 During this move, we do not expect any downtime for bots. The bot migration is coordinated via an automation script to ensure a seamless transition of Bots, Intents, Knowledge Bases without any downtime.  

### Actions
 We do request that you do not update any configuration related to bots, intents, and Knowledge bases during the maintenance window. 

### Timeframe - Up to 8 hours
We will move all the reporting data for bots to the new environment, which can take approximately 8 hours.  As a result, you will temporarily be unable to see reporting data for previous days during the maintenance timeframe; only the current day's reporting will be available. Once the data is migrated and verified, we will close the maintenance window (Â±10 hours), after which you will be able to see all the reporting data from the previous day(s).

### Impact
There will be a minor inconvenience during the migration timeframe to the consumers having conversations with bots as these will be reset and the dialog will start at the beginning. The user experience for the bot developers will be seamless as the URL will automatically redirect your account to the portal deployed on the new environment.
