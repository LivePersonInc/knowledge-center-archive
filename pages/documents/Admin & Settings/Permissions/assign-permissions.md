Brands wanting to configure specific permissions for LPA users on their account have the ability to create customized profiles within each user role (agent, agent manager, campaign manager and admin). Permissions can be enabled or disabled within each profile as required, to create a custom profile suitable for the LPA user.

Once enabled, these profile(s) will automatically be assigned to LPA users upon log-in, meaning they will then only be able to perform actions within the permission settings assigned to them by the brand.

For greater transparency, when a profile has been assigned to an LPA, this will be displayed on the edit screen for the profile. For example, ‘Assigned to 3 users and LPA’.

## Creating custom LPA user profiles

For greater flexibility in assigning relevant permissions to LPA users, we recommend creating customized LPA user profiles within each role.

1. In the User tab, select add profile. The edit profile screen will appear.
2. Give the profile a name, e.g. LPA user and add a description (optional).
3. Select the role the profile will sit within: agent, agent manager, campaign manager or admin.
4. The permissions assigned to the role will appear automatically enabled or disabled.
5. Switch the toggles on or off to enable or disable individual permissions.
6. To return the profile to the default permissions set, click restore defaults.
7. Save the profile.
