When it comes to doing business on the web, security is always a top priority. In order for the online marketplace to thrive, businesses and consumers alike need to be assured that their sensitive data is well protected. LivePerson offers a secure, reliable and trusted service and platform through which online businesses can safely communicate with their customers.

We recommend a baseline level of protection on your account to ensure the utmost security of your data. For information on the full range of security features offered by LivePerson, please contact your LP account team.

Below are the recommended three steps for baseline account security. To implement these settings, or to receive further information on LivePerson security options, please contact your account manager or LivePerson technical support.


## Step 1: Set your password policy

{: .notice}
To enable any of the following settings, please contact your LivePerson representative.

The password policy settings provide more flexibility to define policies that match your corporate security requirements. Password policies enhance your system security by forcing users to create more complex passwords, or to change their passwords at regular intervals.

| Setting | Description | LivePerson recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum number of characters | The minimum number of characters allowed for a password. | The Conversational Cloud enforces a minimum number of 8 characters. |
| Maximum sequential characters | The maximum number of characters with numerically or alphabetically ascending or descending character codes that can be used in consecutive order in the password. | Set the value to 4. |
| Maximum occurrences of same character | The maximum number of times that the same character can be used in a password. | Set the value to 4. |
| Character type | Alpha character required: Defines whether the password must contain an alphabetic character. Number character required: Defines whether the password must contain a number character. Special character required: Defines whether the password must contain at least one character that is commonly referred to as a special character. Any of the following characters can be used as a special character: ! " \~ . # $ % & '() * + , - . / : ; < = > ?@ \[\] ^ _ { } | Enforce the use of at least two out of the three options mentioned above, for example, Alpha character required + Number character required, or Alpha character required + Special character, etc. |
| Allow username in password | Enables users to enter passwords that are the same as or include the username. | Disable. |
| Restrict commonly used password phrases | Restricts passwords that include commonly used password phrases. | Enable. |
| Expire after number of days | Forces users to change their passwords at regular intervals. | Change users’ passwords at least once every 90 days. |
| Prevent using previous number of passwords | The number of previous passwords which the system will prohibit the user from reusing as a new password. | Set the value to a minimum of 12. |
| Maximum changes per day | The number of times the password can be changed within a single 24-hour period. | Set the value to a maximum of 3. |
| Apply policy to current passwords | Applies these rules to existing passwords. If this option is not selected, the password rules will only apply when a user changes the password, or a new user is added to the system. | Enable. |

## Step 2: Restrict your login options

{: .notice}
To enable any of the following settings, please contact your LivePerson representative.

LivePerson offers the following settings for restricting login options:

| Setting | Description | LivePerson recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failed login policy | Number of consecutive failed login attempts after which the system will automatically and immediately disable that user's account. The account will remain disabled until either an administrator manually enables the account, or the specified number of minutes has passed from when the account was initially disabled. | Set the number of failed logins value to 10, and the number of minutes before enabling value to 30. |
| Reset Password Policy | When a password is reset through the Secure Password Reset feature, a notification email is sent indicating the login name of the user and the date and time that the password was changed. | Add the administrator’s email address. |
| Auto-disable Agent Policy | Any agent that has not logged into the Conversational Cloud within the number of days specified will be automatically disabled. | Set this value to 60. |
| Idle User Policy | Monitors user activity in the Agent Workspace and will, after a predetermined period of inactivity, log the user out of the Conversational Cloud. | Log the user out of the Agent Workspace after 15 minutes of inactivity. In the Users tab footnote, select the third dropdown menu. Select the required period of inactivity before a user is logged out. This setting can be activated by an administrator only. |
| IP restriction policy | Restricts login access to the Agent Workspace, providing enhanced security and control. Login access is restricted to a specified list of IP addresses. If the user's IP address does not belong to the IP address list, then the user will not be able to log in and a message is displayed. | Enable. |

## Step 3: Mask your sensitive data
