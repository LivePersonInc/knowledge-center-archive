For an in-depth and technical overview of Cookie types and properties, please see [this article](https://developers.liveperson.com/cookies-and-liveengage-overview.html) in the Developer Center.

A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the visitors' web browser. It helps the website to remember information about a visit; so when a visitor browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie is sent back to the website by the browser.

LivePerson uses information stored in cookies to maintain session data and to identify returning visitors by saving LivePerson-specific data such as visitor ID and last chat date. It is important to note that the cookies do not contain any private customer data, or any data that can be accessible or useful outside of LivePerson.

## Cookie Solution Types

By default, LivePerson uses the third-party cookie solution type for visitors. However if this is not your preferred option, please contact your Success Manager.

The following lists the cookie solution types offered by LivePerson:

### Third-party (Default)

All browsing and chatting cookies will be set with the LivePerson domain. Some will be set as session cookies and others as persistent cookies in order to identify repeat visitors.

\- If the browser does not support third- party cookies, it will fall back to the **first-party persistent cookie**.

\- As a result of the fall back to **first-party persistent cookies**, additional visitors may be monitored.

\- This is the default cookie setting.

### Third-party session

All browsing and chatting cookies will be session cookies set with the LivePerson domain. With this option the ability to identify repeat visitors will be disabled.

\- If the browser does not support the third-party session cookie it will fall back to the **first- party session cookie.**

\- As a result of the fall back to **first-party persistent cookies**, additional visitors may be monitored.

### First-party persistent cookies with third-party session

Browsing cookies under your website domain will be set by LivePerson as persistent cookies, so that browsing history is available. However duplicates are set as session cookies from the LivePerson domain to allow for monitoring of multiple domains using a single LivePerson site ID.

{: .notice}  
Secure cookies with **first-party cookie** solution types are not supported.

### First-party persistent

Browsing cookies under your website domain will be set by LivePerson as persistent cookies, so that browsing history is available. If a visitor chats, the LivePerson chat window will set a persistent first-party cookie.

{: .notice}  
Secure cookies with **first-party cookie** solution types are not supported.

### First-party session

Cookies are session cookies and will therefore be deleted when the visitor closes their browser. As a result, with this setting you will not see browsing history for returning visitors.

{: .notice}  
Secure cookies with **first-party cookie** solution types are not supported.

## Considerations

The following issues should be considered when working with LivePerson Cookies:

{: .notice}  
For any further clarification on instructions with any of the issues discussed below, please contact _LivePerson Technical Support._

### Secure Cookies

LivePerson supports secure cookies, but require the Monitor Tag to be deployed using HTTPS.

### HttpOnly Attribute

LivePerson is unable to support the HttpOnly attribute because it does not operate through JavaScript, which facilitates the Monitor Tag to collect cookies.

### third-party Cookies - Default

By default, LivePerson uses third-party session and visitor cookies in order to save visitor's tracking information. This is due to the fact that while visitors are browsing your site, the LivePerson cookies are set by the LivePerson domain and not by your website domain.

### Chat Button Tags

If you decide to use a first-party cookie solution, you must ensure that all the static button tags on your account are first-party cookie compatible.
