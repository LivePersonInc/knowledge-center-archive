### Engagement channels

LivePerson Support provides 24x7 chat support. Chat is accessible from the Connection Area. Please contact our chat support for issues of any severity level.

### Severity definitions and service levels

Each issue that is identified by the LivePerson Network Operations Center or reported by LivePerson customers is assigned a severity level and is tracked according to the following service levels. Upon request, customer will promptly provide LivePerson with full cooperation and all information reasonably requested by LivePerson to facilitate the investigation of all support issues (e.g., test account information, user ID's, access to customer’s mobile application etc.). Customer acknowledges that its inability to provide all requested information by LivePerson may affect the time periods set forth below and LivePerson shall not be in breach of its obligations herein or be responsible for such delays.

Severity level | Description | Response time | Periodic updates | Preliminary root cause analysis
--- |:--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | LivePerson Products/Services are unavailable or severely degraded and have a significant impact on the customer's business functions and practices. No workaround is available. Security incidents (availability of service due to DOS/DDOS attack, suspected/actual data compromise) are included in this level. | 1 hour | 2 hours | 3 business days
2 | LivePerson Products/Services are available but degraded and the impact on customer's business functions and practices is moderate. A workaround may be available. | 3 hours | 1 business day | Not applicable
3 | System performance issues or bugs affecting some but not all users/website visitors. Short term workaround is available, but not scalable. | 3 business days | 3 business days | Not applicable

**Please note:**
* **Response time** is a verbal response (including phone), or written response, or electronic response (via the LivePerson Service Status Dashboard or via chat) from LivePerson to customers regarding an issue with LivePerson products.
* **Periodic updates** are displayed on the LivePerson Service Status Dashboard.
* **Preliminary Root Cause Analysis** is LivePerson's preliminary investigation into the root cause of an incident that occurred on our platform or products. The document describes the information available to LivePerson at the time the document is written.
* **Final Root Cause Analysis** LivePerson will continue to investigate the incident and deliver a final document that outlines the preventative measures implemented by LivePerson as soon as commercially feasible based on the nature and complexity of the incident.
* **Enhanced Service Levels (SLAs)**  Quickest resolution & response time, available for customers who purchased ‘Enhanced Support packages’ (for additional fee). For details [click here](https://www.liveperson.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/docs/LP-Enhanced-Support-Packages.pdf).

## Service-related updates

LivePerson provides service incident notifications and maintenance activity updates on the [LivePerson Service Status
Dashboard](https://status.liveperson.com).

LivePerson maintains an **Emergency Contact** distribution list of customers for communicating special notifications (such as daylight savings time updates, etc.). Communications regarding these special notifications are provided via email to the customer’s emergency contacts. The customer is required to submit contact information, including an email, of a designated emergency contact, in order to receive such special notifications from LivePerson.

**Please note:**
* LivePerson Customer Support requires each customer to provide an email address of at least one emergency contact, in case we need to contact you.
* It is the responsibility of the customer to notify LivePerson Customer Support of all changes to their emergency contact(s). LivePerson strongly recommends that the customer establish a single global email address (distribution list) for emergency contacts.
* We recommend adding support@liveperson.com to your organizational mail server’s safe senders list to ensure that you receive e-mails from us
