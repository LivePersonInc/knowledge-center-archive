Defining your campaign time frame allows you to set the days and hours in which your campaign will be considered active, and the engagements defined on the campaign will be displayed to your consumers as they navigate through your website or mobile app. When a consumer visits your website or mobile app, engagements from campaigns that are defined as active may be displayed to the consumer while engagements from inactive campaigns will not be displayed to the consumer at all.

This configuration allows you to define several campaigns, each with its own time frame, and display different engagements to your consumers based on your working hours. It gives call centers added flexibility and helps brands to target users effectively.

## Accessing the time frame page

1. From the campaigns list, select a specific campaign.
2. On the campaign page, hover over the **Campaign time frame** and click **Edit.**

## Defining the active time frame

2. Choose the End date. You may also define the End date as **No end date**, so that that campaign will stay active until it is manually changed.
