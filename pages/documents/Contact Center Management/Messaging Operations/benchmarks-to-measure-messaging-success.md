The most common question contact centers ask after deciding to embrace asynchronous messaging is: how should I measure the success of messaging?  This includes having the ability to measure agent productivity, customer satisfaction, and ROI.

While some KPIs for asynchronous messaging resemble traditional ones for session-based interactions that handle voice calls, live chat, or offline ticketing, [messaging cannot be measured the same way](contact-center-management-messaging-operations-managing-a-contact-center-that-messages.html). That’s because messaging is asynchronous, with a thread and history that stays in place so agents and consumers can jump back in the conversation at any time. Meaning, messaging does not always have a clear start or end to a conversation. To highlight the effectiveness of asynchronous messaging, a supplemental set of messaging-specific KPIs need to be established.

LivePerson has developed a set of proprietary data KPIs that enable brands to track and monitor the performance and success of their messaging programs.

## 4 Baseline KPIs & metrics for messaging

### 1. Measuring Consumer Experience (MCS) score

| Metric | Benchmark | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCS | +20 - +30 | Meaningful Connection Score is an automated, real-time measurement of customer satisfaction through the analysis of sentiment that is applied to each message in a conversation. The MCS range is between -100 to 100. |

LivePerson’s proprietary consumer sentiment analysis software that measures the consumer experience in real time is called [Meaningful Connection Score (MCS)](data-reporting-meaningful-connection-score-(mcs)-meaningful-connection-score-(mcs)-overview.html). The MCS technology doesn’t rely on customers answering surveys, but rather automatically conducts an analysis of the tone, content, and sentiment of consumer’s actual conversations with the brand in real time. The **MCS range** is between -100 to 100 where negative words and connotations will result in a negative number, and positive words will result in a positive number.

MCS can also be applied to skill, agent, agent group and line of business to get a full picture of any aspect of their operational performance. This allows the following applications:

* Real-time alerts
* Training opportunities
* Tracking broader brand performance

MCS is superior to traditional customer satisfaction methods because it uses text analytics and NLP, which does not require any action from consumers. Once action is required by a consumer, bias often clouds the data: Consumers who fill in CSAT tend to be more satisfied than the ones who don't. Additionally, only 15%-30% of brand's consumers fill in CSAT rendering it an unreliable measurement of satisfaction of the entire consumer population.

### 2. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

| Metric | Benchmark | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSAT (%) | 85%; or, higher than voice channel | Survey-based customer satisfaction measurements that can be compared to voice. |

Similarly to MCS, CSAT provides a high-level diagnostics of customer experience. Using LivePerson’s Post Conversation Survey bot brands can setup a Q&A experience triggered after a conversation between a consumer and an agent concludes. Through this conversational experience, between the Survey Bot and the consumer, qualitative KPIs should be captured.

### 3. Closed conversations per login hour (CCPLH)

| Metric | Benchmark | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CCPLH | 2x voice calls per hour (ex 7.5) | Main agent and program efficiency metrics by which messaging programs should be measured. It is also the best efficiency criteria to compare to voice. |

{: .notice}
Closed conversations per login hour measure the amount of conversations an agent closes that are not followed by a repeat consumer contact to the same skill. Brands should leverage their current CCPLH as a baseline, with the ultimate goal of achieving at least two times voice calls per hours. Be sure ‘Skill and Group’ filters are set correctly when reviewing CCPLH.

### 4. Resolution rate

| Metric | Benchmark | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolution rate (%) | ± 80% | Percentage of total messaging conversations that were closed and the consumer did not return within 0-3 days. Standard measurement of “resolved” cases to determine program efficiency. |

The resolution rate is a program efficiency metric that gives brands an indication of if they have created the right messaging program to meet their consumers needs (are you engaging consumers at the right time? Are agents resolving conversations on time?). LivePerson has set the standard of three days as the cut off metrics for conversation resolution, meaning if a consumer doesn’t return with the same issue after three days, the conversation is considered to be resolved.

Through the resolution tab, brands can determine how many login hours their program is spending on unresolved conversations. Using the supplemental analyses - automation, transfer, agent effectiveness and resolution, brands can pinpoint reasons for returning consumers.

### Reporting on messaging KPIs

Together with a proprietary customer satisfaction management tools to measure the consumer experience, demand, and overall contact center performance, LivePerson reports are tailored for asynchronous messaging. See the [Data & Reporting section](data-reporting-business-reporting-metrics.html) for more information on where to see these metrics.
