## How to access the MCS toolkit

There are three methods to login to the MCS toolkit:

1. Regular login (via Conversational Cloud username/password)
2. Simultaneous Login (via LivePerson SSO) (_*available by request_)
3. Agent SSO login (via Agent SSO)

### Regular login method

1\. Any valid Conversational Cloud user may login at: [https://mcs.liveperson.net/login](https://mcs.liveperson.net/login "https://mcs.liveperson.net/login")

2\. Before login, select the dashboard type: messaging or chat

3\. Login via regular method will terminate any existing Conversational Cloud session

### Simultaneous login method

1\. To enable simultaneous login, please contact your account manager

2\. Once enabled, access the simultaneous login at: [https://mcs.liveperson.net/sso](https://mcs.liveperson.net/sso "https://mcs.liveperson.net/sso")

3\. Enter your account number and select the dashboard mode

4\. You will be redirected to a Conversational Cloud login page and can continue to login as normal

5\. You may also bypass step 3 by adding your account number and mode to the URL: [https://mcs.liveperson.net/sso?accountId=123&mode=messaging](https://mcs.liveperson.net/sso?accountId=123&mode=messaging "https://mcs.liveperson.net/sso?accountId=123&mode=messaging") (replacing “123” with your account number without quotes, and mode with either “messaging” or “chat” without quotes)

### **Agent SSO method:**

In order to access the MCS toolkit via Agent SSO:

1. Refer to [SSO Guide](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/security-regulations-login-sso-unified-login.html)
2. Ensure that the lpservice URL parameter referred to in the “configuration on the customer’s environment” section of the SSO guide is equal to mcs (e.g. lpservice=mcs)

### Once you are logged in you will be able to:

* Evaluate your overall contact center performance as indicated by consumer experience.
* Benchmark agents and agent groups against each other, using MCS distribution to compare performance, recognizing weaknesses and strengths in the performance of agents or agent groups.
* Leverage data to inform performance reviews and coaching sessions with individual agents or groups, and use examples of the highest and lowest ranked conversations for valuable training cases.
* Drill down to a specific conversation under investigation and jump directly to the point in the conversation where the MCS was negatively affected.
* Perform custom offline analysis by exporting messaging interaction or Engagement History API data direct to a CSV file via the the MCS toolkit data tables.
