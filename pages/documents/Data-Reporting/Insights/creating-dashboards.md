    ![](img/creating_dashboards_insights4.png)

  **N-gram generator** - This analysis goes through the chats/conversations and pulls out buzzwords which are based on their frequency in all of the verbatims. It generates a buzzword word cloud

  **Geo Tag**- It creates a geo map based on the user’s IP address location (if IP address is included in your data).

  **Language Detection** - identifies the languages being used in the transcripts
Sentiment Analysis - provides an average sentiment score for the entire verbatim 
User Analysis- this is to determine the gender of the user (Insights does not recommend using this analysis for our type of data)

**Deploying a Taxonomy:**

  ![](img/sharing_dashboards_insights_1.png)

3\. The dashboard can be shared with users by searching their e-mail in the search bar. Once an e-mail is added to the account, the user can have different user rights. If a user group is already there, then you can see what type of user right that group can have.

{: .notice}
Users must set up an account first before they can view dashboards. For the account to be set up, please e-mail helpdesk@lp-insights.freshservice.com. 

4\. Click on “Owner” to see all options
  * Can View: users can view widgets but cannot permanently modify it.
  * Can Edit: can view and modify the dashboard, but cannot share it with others.
  * Can Share: can edit and share the dashboard with others, but cannot remove others’ access.
  * Owner: can edit, share, and add or remove users with less privilege.

5\. Once a user right is selected, click “+” so that group/user has access to the dashboard.

{: .notice}
A user can modify other users’ right only if they are the owner of the dashboard.
