## Update on Advanced Messaging Dashboard
The Advanced Messaging Dashboard was originally built to solve for critical messaging reporting needs that could not be served elsewhere.  All of those reporting needs are now being served by either the Analytics Builder [Predefined Dashboards](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-analytics-builder-predefined-dashboards.html) or other reporting tools within LivePerson.  Thus, this dashboard is undergoing a sunset plan, with end-of-life planned in Q3 2021.  Please work with your account team to migrate to the [Predefined Dashboards](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-analytics-builder-predefined-dashboards.html) as soon as possible.

## Key Components of the Dashboard

### Monitor
Clearly highlight Primary Messaging KPI trends over time to show successes and opportunities for improvement.

### Diagnose
Detailed reporting allows the user to drill into segments of a program to pinpoint issues and track improvement.

### Test and Learn

One key objective of Advanced Messaging Dashboard 3.0 is to provide a platform to seamlessly benchmark current performance, adjust program levers, and track incremental improvement. This applies to account configuration, automation, and program operations.

### Support
Any customization on top of that analysis carries a risk of changing the narrative of the analysis. Please note that customizations will not be supported by LPSupport LivePerson. If you do customize, please Save-As and give the file a different name.

## How to enable

New versions of Advanced Messaging Dashboard 3.0 are no longer being uploaded, as the data from this dashboard is now available in the Predefined Dashboards in Analytics Builder.

## Segments of the dashboard
Advanced Messaging Dashboard 3.0 contains 7 core analysis segments:

### Performance

* How healthy are my primary Messaging KPIs in relation to LivePerson best practices?
* How are those KPIs influenced by the end-to-end conversation flow?

### Automation

* Are my current bot implementations increasing Efficiency while keeping constant or improving Customer Experience measures?

### Transfer

* Which Skills are conversations being sent from and to?
* Are there any breakpoints causing consumers to drop from the Transfer queue?

### Agent Effectiveness
* How well are my operational Messaging KPIs performing over time?
* What are my coaching opportunities?

### Resolution

* How much labor am I spending on repeat conversations due to unresolved cases?
* Are my Auto-close settings causing premature closures?

## How to use Tabs and Panels

### Tabs

* Correspond to an analysis (Automation, Agent Effectiveness, etc.)
* Contain their own set of filters, meaning you have to set filters each time you switch tabs
* Typically contain between 3-8 Panels (see below)

### Panels

* Correspond to individual components within an analysis
* Maintain the filters that are set at the tab level, meaning filters do not need to be reset when navigating between panels
* May also contain filters within the visualization, allowing you to further drill down on the data that has been selected at the Tab level.

## How to use Filters within Tabs and Panels

### Filters

**Tab Level**

*  Apply to all Panels within a Tab
* Default to past 28 days, all Skills, all Groups, and all User Types

**Visualization Level**

* Apply only to the Panel that contains theFilter
* Allow you to drill into very detailed data, such as Agent-level and Hour of Day

## Performance metrics

| Metric Name | Metric formula | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closed Conversations Per Login Hour (CCPLH) | CLOSED CONVERSATIONS / LOGIN HOURS | Efficiency measure of how many conversations were completed (closed) per hour of agent time spent logged in. |
| Resolution Rate (Based on 0-3 Day RCR) | REPEAT 0-3 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID DID NOT OPEN a subsequent conversation within 3 days. This is LivePerson's standard measure of a resolved conversation. |
| Agent Participation Rate | (CLOSED CONVERSATIONS - ABANDONED CONVERSATIONS) / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS| Percentage of Closed Conversations where the AGENT sent at least one message. This is the inverse of Abandon Rate. |
| RCR 1 Hour | REPEAT 1 HOUR / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation within 1 hour. This measurement is a prime indicator of conversations that are closed prematurely. |
| RCR 1 Day | REPEAT 1 DAY / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 1 Hour and 1 day. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. This measurement also indicates conversations that are closed prematurely, although these conversations are not being reopened as urgently as 1 Hour Repeats. |
| RCR 3 Day | REPEAT 3 DAY / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 1 day and 3 days. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. This measurement indicates the threshold at which a reopened conversation is still considered unresolved. |

## Automation contents

## Automation metrics

| Metric Name | Metric formula | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bot Involved Handled Conversations | Sum(Case((\[USER TYPE\]@DESC=”Bot”),\[HANDLED CONVERSATIONS\],0)){\~+} | The number of conversations in which a BOT agent sent at least one message during the selected timeframe. |
| Human Only Handled Conversations | HANDLED CONVERSATIONS - BOT-INVOLVED HANDLED CONVERSATIONS | The number of conversations in which a HUMAN agent sent at least one message and BOTS sent no messages during the selected timeframe.|
| Bot Routing Success Rate | TRANSFERS / HANDLED CONVERSATIONS | Successful transfers (routes) completed by Routing Bot. This is a primary KPI that should be maximized for all Routing Bots. |
| Human Resolution Success Rate | (1 - (TRANSFERS / HANDLED CONVERSATIONS)) * (1 - REPEAT 0-3 DAYS) | Successful closures (1-Transfer Rate) completed by Humans after Routing, multiplied by the Resolution Rate (1 - REPEAT 0-3 DAYS). This is a leading indicator of the accuracy of the Routing Bot, as well as the ability of Human Agents to fully resolve cases.|
| Time Spent with Bot vs Human (Mins) | AVG. CONVERSATION DURATION where USER TYPE = "Human" / "Bot" / "Unassigned"| Breakdown of Avg Conversation Duration spent with the Bot, Unassigned, and with a Human. |
| Est. Consumer Responses Sent Per Conversation | (TOTAL NO. OF AGENT RESPONSES / HANDLED CONVERSATIONS) - 1 | We measure Responses sent by the Bot or Agent as a proxy for the number of Consumer actions taken to navigate through the Routing Bot. For example, if a Bot sends 5 Responses per Conversation, this implies that the Consumer has had to respond 4 times.|
| Bot Routing Success Rate | TRANSFERS / HANDLED CONVERSATIONS | Successful transfers (routes) completed by Routing Bot. |
| Close Rate | 1 - BOT ROUTING SUCCESS RATE | Percentage of Closed Conversations that were closed while with the Routing Bot. Ideally this metric will be very low. |
| In Queue Abandon Rate | IN QUEUE ABANDONS / CONVERSATIONS IN QUEUE | Percentage of Conversations In Queue that are abandoned before being assigned.
| Assignment Rate | ASSIGNED CONVERSATIONS / CONVERSATIONS IN QUEUE | Percentage of Conversations In Queue that are assigned. |
| Post Assign Abandon Rate | POST ASSIGN ABANDONS / CONVERSATIONS ASSIGNED TO SKILL | Percentage of Conversations In Queue that are abandoned after being assigned, meaning the conversation was closed before an Agent message was sent. |

## Agent effectiveness - metrics

| Metric Name | Metric formula | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adjusted CCPLH (RCR and Load) | (\[CLOSED CONVERSATIONS PER LOGIN HOUR\]*\[ RESOLUTION RATE\])/\[AGENT LOAD\] | Closed Conversations Per Login Hour only tells one piece of the agent efficiency story. This metric adjusts CCPLH for case resolution and agent capacity. |
| ART and ART During Agent Shift | n/a | Same as the AVG RESPONSE MINS BY AGENT DURING SHIFT metric (name shortened to fit on graph on Experience panel and grids on Agent Analysis and Weekly Detail panels). |
| ART Consumer | n/a | same as the AVG. CONSUMER RESPONSE MINS metric (name shortened to fit on graph on Experience panel). |
| TTFR and TTFR (Assign+Transfer) | n/a | Same as the AVG. MINS TO FIRST AGENT RESPONSE FROM AGENT ASSIGNMENT INCLUDING TRANSFERS metric (name shortened to fit on graph on Experience panel and grids on Agent Analysis and Weekly Detail panels). |
| Top Agent |  Case(((\[N-TILE CCPLH\]>=4)And(\[N-TILE MCS\]>=4)), 1, 0) {N=5} | Identifies top 20% of performers in terms of CCPLH and MCS. These two metrics were chosen because they are universal indicators of efficiency and experience across all agents. |
| RCR 1 Hour | REPEAT 1 HOUR / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation within 1 hour. This measurement is a prime indicator of conversations that are closed prematurely. |
|Agent Participation Rate | (CLOSED CONVERSATIONS - ABANDONED CONVERSATIONS) / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the AGENT sent at least one message. This is the inverse of Abandon Rate. |

## Resolution contents

### Repeat Contact Impact

**Analysis objective:** While closing conversations is key to maintaining efficiency, it means nothing if consumer issues are not resolved. Here we introduce RCR and Agent Load into the Efficiency calculation, as well as demonstrate the amount of labor being spent on unresolved conversations.

**Questions answered:**  How much labor am I spending on repeat conversations due to unresolved conversations? Which Skills/Groups have the highest RCR?

### RCR | Date

**Analysis objective:**  Provide a deeper dive into each component of RCR and show the implication of consumers returning within certain timeframes.

**Questions answered:** Are my Auto-close settings causing premature closures?

## Resolution metrics

| Metric Name | Metric formula | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolution Rate (Based on 0-3 Day RCR) | REPEAT 0-3 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID DID NOT OPEN a subsequent conversation within 3 days. This is LivePerson's standard measure of a resolved conversation. |
| RCR Based 4-30 Day Adoption Rate | REPEAT 4-30 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation after 3 days and within 30 days. This is LivePerson's standard measure of consumers returning for new cases, and thus adopting messaging.NOTE - this metric in its current state serves as a directional proxy for channel adoption, but it is still not an official adoption figure since it only covers a 30 day period. If you compare this number to voice, be sure to compare like-for-like time periods.|
| Adjusted CCPLH (RCR and Load) | (\[CLOSED CONVERSATIONS PER LOGIN HOUR\]*\[ RESOLUTION RATE\])/\[AGENT LOAD\] | Closed Conversations Per Login Hour only tells one piece of the agent efficiency story. This metric adjusts CCPLH for case resolution and agent capacity.

| Est. Login Hours Spent on Unresolved | REPEAT 0-3 DAYS / ACTUAL CCPLH | Holding CCPLH constant, this is the estimated agent time spent on taking repeat conversations within 3 days due to cases not being resolved in the initial conversation. |
| Agent or Consumer Close Rate | AGENT CLOSE RATE + CONSUMER CLOSE RATE | The Agent and Consumer Close Rates are consolidated into one metric in this analysis, because the primary focus is on the relationship between SYSTEM CLOSE RATE and RCR |
| RCR 1 HOUR | REPEAT 1 HR / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation within 1 hour. This measurement is a prime indicator of conversations that are closed prematurely and are UNRESOLVED. |
| RCR 1 DAY | REPEAT 1 DAY / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 1 Hour and 1 day. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. This measurement also indicates conversations that are UNRESOLVED, although these conversations are not being reopened as urgently as 1 Hour Repeats. |
| RCR 3 DAY | REPEAT 3 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 1 day and 3 days. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. This measurement indicates the threshold at which a reopened conversation is still considered UNRESOLVED. |
| RCR 7 DAY | REPEAT 7 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 3 days and 7 days. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. These conversations are typically considered RESOLVED. |
| RCR 14 DAY | REPEAT 14 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 7 days and 14 days. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. These conversations are typically considered RESOLVED. |
| RCR 30 DAY | REPEAT 30 DAYS / CLOSED CONVERSATIONS | Percentage of Closed Conversations where the same ConsumerID opened a subsequent conversation between 14 days and 30 days. This RCR measurement is mutually exclusive, meaning RCR 1 Hour (for example) is not included. These conversations are typically considered RESOLVED. |

**Questions answered:** How well are Login Hours paired with Opened Conversations at each interval?  How do Demand and Supply impact Agent Load and Active Rate?

## Discontinued Sections of Advanced Messaging Dashboard
Several sections of the original Advanced Messaging Dashboard were serving reporting needs that have since been filled using more appropriate tools.  Those sections include Capacity, Usage, Automation, and Resolution.  These sections may still be available in customized copies of Advanced Messaging Dashboard, but they are no longer supported by LivePerson Support or Analytics.
