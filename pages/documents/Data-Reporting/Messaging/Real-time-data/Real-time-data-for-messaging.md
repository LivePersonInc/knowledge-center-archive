## Real time data bar

As an agent manager, you want to have an overall picture of how your agents are performing at any given time. The data bar provides you with a snapshot of the basic information you need to track agent efficiency and operational performance.

**OPEN -** displays the total number of current open conversations.

**PENDING** - displays the total number of conversations pending agent response.

**OVERDUE** - displays the total number of conversations that exceeded the target response time.

**SOON TO BE OVERDUE** - displays the total number of conversations about to exceed the target response time in 5 minutes.

**UNASSIGNED** - displays the total number of conversations that are waiting to be assigned to an agent.

**CSAT** - displays the customer satisfaction score, based on surveys that were completed in the last 12 hours. The calculation is (Total number of positive answers) / (Total number of answers). The data is retrieved from LivePerson's [Messaging Operations API](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-operations-api-overview.html).
