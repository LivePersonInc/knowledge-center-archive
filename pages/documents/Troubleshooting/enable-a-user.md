This procedure describes how to enable or re-enable a user who has been disabled from your Conversational Cloud account. A user might have been disabled for one of the following reasons:

* The user didn’t log in for 90 days or more
* The user got locked out after attempting password reset too many times

{: .notice}
Only users with administrator permissions can enable another user. Admin users can also reset other users’ passwords. 

To enable a disabled user, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Conversational Cloud account. 
2. Select the Manage users and skills icon on the left hand side. The User Management screen is displayed.
