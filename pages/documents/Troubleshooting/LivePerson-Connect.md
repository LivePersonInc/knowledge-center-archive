Please note that the Australia version of LivePerson Connect (formerly known as ContactAtOnce!) is no longer supported by LivePerson.  This change does not impact the United Kingdom and North American versions of the product.  

Instead of LivePerson Connect, we are upgrading our customers to the Conversational Cloud platform. The Conversational Cloud is an AI-powered conversational platform using state of the art machine learning that transforms brands into intent-driven conversational enterprises. The Conversational Cloud makes it possible to understand consumer intents in real-time to inform critical business decisions and automate consumer interactions at scale on all the popular messaging channels. 

LivePerson will retain customer data for 13 months, until June 30, 2022. Customers may request access to their historical Connect data by following these instructions.
