Enhanced by automation and featuring an upgraded design, the Agent Workspace has been updated to boost your efficiency as an agent and improve the productivity of messaging operations. The new design caters specifically to the unique demands of messaging, featuring self-serve capabilities and utilizing automatic algorithms on the backend to dynamically prioritize conversations for you. This new dynamic list allows agents to work more intuitively, saving precious time and removing the need for guesswork.

## Main enhancements to the Agent Workspace

**New UI:** The platform’s new look and feel was designed to give agents maximum efficiency in messaging operations. With the conversation list prominently displayed and easy access to all your widgets, you will be able to handle more conversations concurrently with ease. 

**Recommendation of next conversation to answer:** Dynamic conversation list features built-in automation that tells you which conversation to answer next, removing the need for decision making that can be time consuming and prone to human error. 
New idle status filter: The addition of the new ‘idle’ status filter allows you to determine which conversations have been pending a consumer response for over five minutes.

**Enhanced conversation summary:** The conversation summary widget has been enhanced to support the entering of multiple notes by several agents. When handling conversations that have been transferred and owned by several agents, this will allow you to see a log of comments for context. 

**History in transcript:** The conversation history now appears directly in the transcript so that you can easily access past conversations, rather than needing to navigate to a dedicated widget. 

**Closed conversation status filter:** Closed conversations can be filtered into the conversation list by status, allowing agents to ensure that all their documentation is in place when wrapping up their shift. 

**Idle conversation status and filter:** When a consumer hasn't responded in five minutes or longer, a conversation is marked with the new idle status. You can filter these conversations out for a more focused conversation list. 

**Agent survey:** The agent survey, which was previously available only for chat, allows brands to collect feedback from agents after their conversations are complete. This information can then be used to optimize messaging operations.
