To ensure you are fully prepared for the new experiences, we have created a comprehensive checklist with all the steps you need to take. Please check off each item as it is completed to stay organized and make the transition as smooth as possible.

## Step 1 - Know what’s coming

Since all users of your brand will be getting something new - it is important that are are fully aware of the upcoming changes by role - and how to prepare for them.

Resources available to you:

1. Direct communications from your CSM

2. This website, that includes:

    1. What’s new for messaging agents

    2. What’s new for messaging managers

    3. What’s new for admins

    4. What’s new for live chat users

    5. For brands using both live chat and messaging

Note: If you are on live chat only, the changes to the UI are cosmetic only and will not affect your users workflows. The following checklist applies to brands using messaging.

## Step 2 - Select your 'go-live' dates

1. Validate go-live date for messaging managers: For messaging managers: the automatic go-live date for everyone is Sept 16th. The new workspace will become the new homepage automatically.

    1. You can turn this off for a select group of managers if you wish to roll this out gradually, but ensure you have a date and work plan in the books.

2. Set up a go-live date for messaging agents. The enhanced Agent Workspace will be turned ‘off’ by default and will only display when you choose.

    2. Determine if you’d like to enable all your agents at the same date?

    3. Determine if you’d like to do a gradual release to your agents

        1. Decide on a date to transition the first group of agents

        2. Determine groups and dates to go-live for all your agents  

## Step 3 - Get your agents & managers prepared & excited

Based on your defined go-live dates, you can build hype and excitement within your contact center - so that they tools be smoothly adopted.

Some ideas of how you can use this information:

* Send weekly emails to managers and agents - with a ‘reason to get excited’ in each one

* Add the videos to your contact center’s display screens

## Step 4: Schedule training sessions

1. Your CSM will work with you to ensure your trainers or SME’s receive a ‘train the trainer’ session so they are comfortable with all the materials

2. Schedule the date for your managers training before September 16th

    1. Adjust the dates and groups based on your determined rollout plan

3. Schedule the agent training sessions based on your define rollout date

    2. You can also send this quick video tutorial to your agents as prep work or as a reminder.

* [Manager training video](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/agent-manager-workspace-manager-tools-for-messaging-new-manager-workspace-for-messaging-tutorial.html)

## Step 5 - Testing

You can test the new Manager Workspace and enhanced Agent Workspace by enabling the permissions on your test or sandbox account.  Alternatively, you can create a test user on your production account and only assign the new workspace to them.

Best practice: ensure one of your SMEs at least has tested and successfully used the new workspace before rolling out to all agents.

To get early access for testing, please contact your LivePerson account team.

## Step 6 - Set up 

1. Schedule go-live date, including any transition groups or waves.

2. To enable the new workspaces to a select group of users, create a new profile with the appropriate permission turned on.

Best practices:

**For blended accounts:** Because the enhanced agent and new Manager Workspaces are for messaging only, we recommend separating your messaging and live chat operations as a best practice. This means having either dedicated agents who handle only chat or only messaging conversations, or having agents with multiple logins who handle chat and messaging during different shifts. To learn more about working with blended accounts, [click here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/agent-manager-workspace-agent-tools-for-messaging-enhanced-agent-workspace-for-messaging-blended-accounts.html).

**Implement auto accept.** Contact centers can choose whether to have conversations automatically assigned to agents or to have agents manually accept conversations that ring in their workspace. We recommend using auto accept as a best practice, because it helps to maximize agent capacity and ensure that conversation routing is as rapid and efficient as possible. To learn more about how conversations are distributed and accepted, [click here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/contact-center-management-messaging-operations-automatic-messages-automatic-conversation-distribution.html#accepting-a-conversation).

Manage your SLAs. As a best practice, we recommend setting the SLA

## Step 7 - Go-Live :)

On the day of go- live, assign agents the profiles with the ‘enhanced Agent Workspace’ assigned.
