The LivePerson agent app is an iOS application for iPads & iPhones that allows agents and agent managers to message with consumers on-the-go. The current app offers simple messaging capabilities and can help agents that are working from home to continue to provide services to their consumers.

In addition to allowing reps to work remotely, the app also expands opportunities for messaging scenarios. For example, in stores, retail reps can leverage their down time by messaging with customers not in store, utilizing retail reps as agents and giving them the power to increase sales.

Please note that all functionality discussed in this article applies to both the iPad & iPhone.

## Agent flow

### Empty state

The first time the agent logs in to the app it appears to be in an empty state. This is because the the agent has no assigned conversations and no new conversation ringing. All agent’s conversations were ended (either manually or automatically).

### Accepting the conversation

Tapping the "accept" button assigns the conversation to the agent and opens the conversation. Tapping accept opens only 1 conversation at a time, even if there are multiple conversations ringing for the agent.

### Ignoring the conversation

An agent can ignore ringing conversations. After a preset time (the default is 1m), the conversation will move to the next available agent (as decided by LivePerson’s agent availability algorithm).

{: .notice}  
The app filters out conversations with unassigned skills. Unassigned skill conversations will not be received in the agent app.

### Conversation top bar

### Send icon

Tapping the send icon adds the text to the conversation and sends it to the consumer.

### Conversation message: agent side

Agent side conversation messages appear with a white background.  
Below the agent bubble there is an indication for the agent name and a time stamp. In addition there is a message status icon “v” indication: sent, delivered and read (similar to the whatsApp indications).

### Auto messages/system messages

Automatic messages or system messages display in a grey color without a bubble centered in the screen.

### Conversation history

When an agent accepts new conversations, he sees the new message arrive. In addition, if there are previous conversations in the history the last conversations will appear as well. The agent is able to scroll up to reveal the history of additional closed messaging conversations with the consumer.

## Agent action menu

### Send back to queue

Tapping the ‘Send back to queue’ action removes the agent assignment from the conversation and sends it back to the skill queue. The position of the conversation in the queue is determined by LivePerson’s algorithm (currently it is positioned at the end of the queue, but enhancements to the algorithm are in progress).

### End conversation

In case the conversation is no longer relevant and is not needed for future reference, the agent may end the conversation. This hides the conversation from the list and it can subsequently only be accessed via Agent manager or from Conversational Cloud Web. On Conversational Cloud Web, closed conversations can be reopened when the agent sends a new message. In future phases the list may include closed conversations and the ability to reopen them, based on the relevant use case.

### Inactive conversations

Inactive conversations can be closed automatically using the Auto-close feature. This feature closes conversations after a configurable time during which the consumer has been idle. Contact your LivePerson account team to configure this feature.

![](/img/agent action menu app.png)

## Predefined content

### Link preview

When sending a URL to a consumer, it is published to the consumer with a preview of the website. The preview appears below the original message and link.

## The conversation list

### Conversation list order

The agent usually sees multiple conversations on their conversation list. Every conversation is color-coded for easy identification by the agent. The color-code can be seen on the outer ring of each consumer avatar.

The list is sorted according to the response time (SLA). If there is no response time because the conversation is pending a consumer response, then the list is sorted according to last modified conversation by the agent  (top to bottom).

### The dynamic list behavior and transition

When the conversation status changes, e.g. when an agent responds to an overdue conversation, the position of the conversation in the queue changes accordingly.

{: .notice}  
Agents can only view open conversations. In future phases it may include closed conversations, based on the relevant use case.

### Conversation list indications

Conversations pending an agent response have response time indications on right side. In the case where a conversation is overdue (at the top according to sorting logic), a red bell icon is displayed

{: . notice}
The app filters out conversations with unassigned skills. Unassigned skill conversations will not be displayed in the connections list

## Bulk back to queue

### Multi-selection mode

Users can return multiple conversations back to queue at once. By tapping and holding on the conversation area or by tapping the consumer avatar the list switches to multi-selection mode. Users can continue tapping each conversation to select/deselect it.

To exit and abort multi-selection mode, users can tap the ‘cancel’ button on the top bar.

### Bottom action bar

User can select “Mark all” to select all conversation. Once all conversation are marked the button changes to “Clear all”

To return selected conversation back to queue, users can tap to “Return to queue” button.

### Returning back to queue process

When returning multiple conversation back to queue, a progress bar pop-up will appear.

{: . notice}  
Only open and assigned conversation will be returned to the queue.

If some of the open conversations were not successfully returned to queue, a proper message will be prompted and these conversations will remain selected.

If all conversations were successfully returned to queue, they will disappear from the agent list.

This is relevant for agent managers who can view closed and in queue conversations.

![](/img/bulk back to queue (1).png)

## Searching the list

### Search bar

Using the search bar, the agent can search for a consumer’s name (or phone number in the SMS source) to reach a conversation quickly. Clearing the search bar (using Cancel or ‘x’) shows the full conversation list.

### Search results list

The conversation list is filtered in real-time with relevant conversation entries that fit the searched name or number. As the conversation list shows only open conversations, the search is valid for these.

## Notifications

### Push notifications

When the agent moves the app to the background, new conversation are received as push notifications. Each push include a generic message that a new conversation is waiting to be accepted.

Each push notification includes:  
_Customer ID:_ showing the name (or phone number) of the consumer who sent the new message.

**_Message excerpt:_** a short excerpt of the new message.

**_Tapping the notification_**: opens the app and focuses on the relevant conversation’s last message.

### App icon badge

As for new conversation, when there is a new conversation while the app is in the background, a waiting conversation badge appears on the Conversational Cloud icon. **The app badge does not sum the number of new conversation waiting**.

{: .notice}  
Enabling the push notifications is done by your LivePerson account team.

When at least one new message is received when the app is in the background, an unread message badge appears on the Conversational Cloud icon. The number sums the unread message in the app. When entering the app the counter is reset.

**Known limitation:** the app icon badge does not sum the new messages and new conversation notification. It display the badge which is relevant to last notification type (conversation/message).

![](/img/Consumer push notification (2).png)

## In app notifications

### In-app notification for new messages

While responding to one consumer, an agent may receive a new message from another. The in-app notification includes:

**Customer ID:**  showing the name (or phone number) of the consumer sending the message.

**_Message excerpt:_** a short excerpt of the new message.

**_Tapping the notification_:** opens the conversation, focusing on the last message.

In-app notifications replace each other, so in case of simultaneous notifications, the last sent message is shown.

### New message badge

When new messages are received, a badge counting the number of new messages appears next the relevant conversation list entry. Tapping the list entry clears the badge.

## Logout

### Return conversation to queue when logging out

User can choose between three options:

1. Automatically return all his assigned open conversations back to queue and logout
2. Logging out without returning the conversation back to queue
3. Cancel - the user will not be logged out and return to previous screen.

## Manager Flow
