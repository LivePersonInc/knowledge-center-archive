At LivePerson we recognize that every brand is unique and employs an individual approach to managing their users.

To ensure that complex organizations have the flexibility to tailor user roles to the distinct way they run their business, the permissions feature within LivePerson provides brands with the opportunity to fully customize each of the four roles:

* Agent
* Agent manager
* Campaign manager
* Admin

![](img/Agent-manager-profile.png)

## Customized profiles

Brands are able to create profiles - customized permissions sets within roles. For example, within the Agent role, Senior Agent and Junior Agent profiles can be created, with permission sets enabled or disabled for each profile. For ease and usability, the Conversational Cloud creates a default permission set per role. Brands can customize these sets and also have the option to create new profiles that meet their specific structural business needs.

In addition to these configurable permission sets, there is a core set of permissions within each role that cannot be disabled. For the full list, refer to the tables below within each role (agent, agent manager, campaign manager & admins).

## Multiple user roles

To ensure small and medium-sized businesses also have flexibility within their user management capabilities, users can now be assigned more than one role. For example, a manager who also takes chats can be assigned both ‘agent manager’ and ‘agent’ roles and a campaign manager who also manages users and takes care of account administration can be assigned both ‘campaign manager’ and ‘admin’ roles.

## More control for agent managers

To further empower agent managers, there will be an additional option to grant this role limited user management permissions, including:

* Create /edit users of agent and agent manager roles within their group’s structure
* Create /edit agent groups within group’s structure
* Create /edit agent and agent manager’s profiles
* Create /edit skills

{: .notice}  
Profiles and users can only be configured by admins and agent managers with special permissions.

**To create or customize a profile:**

1. In the user tab, select **add profile**. The edit profile screen will appear.
2. Select the **role** the profile will sit within: agent, agent manager, campaign manager or admin.
3. Give the profile a name, e.g. senior agent manager and add a description (optional).
4. The permissions assigned to the role will appear automatically enabled. Switch the toggles off to disable individual permissions.
5. To return the profile to the default permissions set, click **restore defaults**.
6. **Save** the profile.

### To create a user and assign a profile:

1\. On the **users** list, click **add user** at the bottom of the page.

2\. Type in the user’s details.

* Login name
* Email address
* User’s name
* User’s nickname (this is the name that will be displayed to visitors in a chat)

3\. Under **assignment**, select the profile(s) that apply to the user. Up to four profiles can be selected, but only one from within each role.

### **_Steps 4 and 5 apply to users with an agent role profile only:_**

4\. Set the maximum number of chats that the user can accept at any given moment. Consider your agent’s capabilities, the number of agents available, etc.

5\. For visitors to be routed to the appropriate agent when they initiate a chat, assign the user a skill:

* Select a skill from the menu by clicking the **skills** field and selecting an existing skill, or
* Create a new skill by typing in the name of the skill in the **skills** field
6\. Set a password. Click **save**.
{: .notice}  
Agents who are not assigned to skills can only accept chats originated by engagements that are not assigned to skills.

## Definitions, permission and default states

A **role** defines the scope of the user’s work. Each **role** encompasses a _unique_ set of permissions. **Roles** cannot be created or edited.

A **profile** is a set of **permissions**, derived from a Conversational Cloud role. **Profiles** can be created and edited.

The tables below list the permissions that can be configured per role, along with their definitions and default state.

### Role: Agent

The following core permissions are included with the agent role and cannot be disabled:

* Ability for agent to change their name, password, regional settings and so on
* Ability to accept any chat or conversation request, within the agent’s maximum concurrency limit
