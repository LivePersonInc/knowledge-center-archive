## Design & Scale with Conversation Builder, Manager and Orchestrator
The Conversation Builder, Conversation Manager, and Conversation Orchestrator are the products that enable brands to build and manage AI-powered chatbots that work together with human experts to generate leads, drive sales, offer support, and build loyalty with brands.

While the names Conversation Builder, Conversation Manager, and Context Warehouse are not changing, Maven and the Maven Workspace is now the Conversation Orchestrator.

Conversation Orchestrator name signifies how this product connects to backend systems to help them work together seamlessly - such as Agent Assist, Dynamic Routing, Conversation Orchestrator APIs and more. From there, the Conversation Orchestrator collects intent, context (backend), and predictive attributes to help route customers to the most optimal bot, human agent, or relevant information. Brands can then design automations that fulfill specific intents, and scale by supervising automations with human agents and supporting agents through recommendations of  relevant information from a Knowledge Base, or suggesting a bot to join.
