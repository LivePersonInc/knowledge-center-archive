## Benefits
The Conversational Marketplace allows consumers to connect with your brand’s businesses, products, and services with AI-powered messaging that can help drive lifetime value and foster consumer relationships. 

* **Personalize your Marketplace for consumers’ preferences**
Businesses on your Conversational Marketplace can quickly answer questions and transact with consumers as they research products and services — on your brand’s site or app or in familiar channels like Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, text messaging, and more.

* **Drive more leads and sales with direct messaging**
Direct communication with businesses makes it easy for their consumers to finalize decisions, so brands can deliver more high-intent leads and sales attribution. 

* **Allow consumers to make appointments or complete transactions in these secure conversations**
Allow consumers to make appointments or complete transactions in these secure conversations — no channel switch required. Attribute that revenue to help prove your brand’s platform’s value.

* **Expand discovery and strengthen retention**
* Increase stickiness by activating conversational entry points beyond your brand’s site for merchants — Apple Business Chat, Google’s Business Messaging, WhatsApp, and more. All conversions will ultimately be attributed to your brand as the source of the conversation.

## Key Components
### Conversational Cloud Account Types in a Marketplace

* **Marketplace Account** — The Marketplace account is the 'provider' account or the Marketplace consumer’s account, which houses the configurations and will serve as the source of all conversations. Businesses that are part of the marketplace are subscribed to this account. Campaigns and Engagements are set-up in this account and will serve as the conversational entry points for your Marketplace.

* **Business Account** — These are the businesses, merchants, or customers that are within the Marketplace.  Any number of brands can be subscribed to a Marketplace and serve as the owners of the conversations. Also, a business account can be a part of other marketplaces. A business account can be The brands that make up a Marketplace can be from many different customer segments: : 

  * *Product and Service Listings*: Marketplaces that list products and services from independently-owned small to medium businesses and enterprise brands.

  * *Franchise and Multilocation*: Parent brands that list, advertise, or enable sales and services for retail and franchise locations on their brand site.

  * *Business Listings*: Marketplaces that list businesses and offer consumers the ability to search, inquire, schedule, or transact. 

* **Conversation Rollover Account** — Conversation Rollover allows conversations to be handled by a different account than they are owned by. A Rollover account can be configured to handle conversations on behalf of the entire Marketplace provider in a single account, which is especially helpful for scaling the automation strategy of the Marketplace. A single bot can be enabled to handle the conversation volume across all brands with an escalation back to the built-in brand account as needed.
