## Benefits
The Conversational Marketplace allows consumers to connect with your brand’s businesses, products, and services with AI-powered messaging that can help drive lifetime value and foster consumer relationships. 

* **Personalize your Marketplace for consumers’ preferences**
Instead of juggling voice, email, and other cumbersome channels, businesses on your Conversational Marketplace can quickly answer questions and transact with consumers as they research products and services — on your brand’s site or app or in familiar channels like Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, text messaging, and more.

* **Drive more leads and sales with direct messaging**
Direct communication with businesses makes it easy for their consumers to finalize decisions, so brands can deliver more high-intent leads and sales attribution. 
Boost conversions with in-channel integrations

* **Allow consumers to make appointments or complete transactions in these secure conversations** — no channel switch required. Attribute that revenue to help prove your brand’s platform’s value.

* **Expand discovery and strengthen retention**
Increase stickiness by activating conversational entry points beyond your brand’s site for merchants — Apple Business Chat, Google’s Business Messaging, WhatsApp, and more. All conversions will ultimately be attributed to your brand as the source of the conversation.
