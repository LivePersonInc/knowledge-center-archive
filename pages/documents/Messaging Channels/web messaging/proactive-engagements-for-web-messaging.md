## Introduction

Offering customers targeted engagements at different stages of their customer journey from beginning to end can lead to an increase in sales and greater customer satisfaction. For example, a customer who appears close to abandoning their cart might be offered immediate sales support, while a visitor hovering over the bill payments page can trigger an offer from an agent to engage.

A proactive engagement campaign, which targets customers based on a certain set of conditions, achieves this by allowing your brand to engage with customers at specific points during their visit to your site, helping to guide them towards a sale and promote customer retention. A wide variety of customer profiles can be targeted based on their geolocation, onsite activities, customer information and more.

## Proactive engagement behavior

Proactive engagements offer a rich, hard to miss experience for consumers and are available in a variety of formats including overlay, toaster and peeling corner. To ensure the experience is both engaging and non-intrusive, LiveEngage offers the following settings:

### Number of displays

This setting allows you to limit the number of times a proactive engagement is displayed in total during a visit. When the limit is reached, no other proactive engagements will be displayed in that visit. You can select from one, two or three times, or unlimited; the default setting is unlimited. You can also choose to select different settings for conversation and content engagements.

### Invite after decline

This setting allows you define the behavior after a consumer declines a proactive engagement, by selecting whether or not other proactive engagements can thereafter be displayed. For example, you can decide to display a proactive conversation engagement for one Line of Business, even if a proactive conversation engagement for a different Line of Business was previously declined.

By default, after declining a proactive content engagement, other content engagements can be displayed; after declining a proactive conversation engagement, conversation engagements cannot be displayed.

## Creating your engagement

To create a proactive campaign, follow these steps:

 1. Click on the _Campaigns tab_ in the top banner of your dashboard, followed by the _Add Campaign_ button in the bottom left corner.
 2. Give the Campaign a relevant name, such as ‘First time visitors’ or ‘Post-purchase support’.
 3. To set your Campaign Goal - how you will measure the success of your campaign - click _Add Goal_ and then _Add New_.
 4. Give your Goal a name, such as ‘Generate Leads’, then select the Goal Type and indicator, which should define what activity will be counted as successful towards this goal. Click _Save_ in the bottom right corner, and then _Done_ on the next page.
 5. Next adjust your Campaign Audience and Campaign Timeframe, selecting the most appropriate parameters to meet your goal.
 6. To add an engagement, click the _Add Engagement_ button on your main campaign page.
 7. You can use this page to customize your engagement by format, use case, style and size - you can even design your own button and tailor it to your brand. For a proactive campaign, we recommend using a sticky, toaster or slide-out format (LiveEngage offers a number of other effective campaign types to meet your needs - see the selection below). Click _Next_.
 8. In the Engagement Studio you can customize different aspects of the Engagement, adding your own branded design if preferred. Click _Save_.
 9. The Window Studio is next, giving you the chance to personalize your conversation window branding and configure surveys. Give your window a name and click _Save_.
10. In the Location Library, you can choose where you would like your button to appear - as this is a proactive campaign, choose the page most appropriate for your engagement. Click _Next_.
11. On the Visitor Behavior Library page, you can define which visitor actions on your website will trigger an engagement, which is important for a proactive campaign. Adjust the values under Navigation, eCommerce and Visitor Journey as required, such as for time spent on location, products in cart and visitor errors. Click _Done_.
12. Lastly, name your Engagement and click _Publish_ - your proactive engagement is now complete.
