With the Google RCS Business Messaging connector, brands can communicate with consumers using Google’s native messaging app, Android Messages. Combined with the messaging operational and automation tools of LivePerson’s platform, it is easy to manage conversations at scale.

## Google RCS vs. SMS

RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a communication protocol between mobile telephone carriers and between phone and carrier, which aims to replace SMS with a text-message system that is richer and supports multimedia.

* RCS is an enhanced version of SMS with Rich Conversation capabilities
* It is built into the default messaging app for Android smartphones - Messages
* In the future, Android Messages with RCS capabilities will be the native messaging app  
  for many other Android devices
* RCS enables seamless conversations across multiple mobile carriers and phone manufacturers that support RCS

## Benefits of Google RCS 

* **Google’s compatibility API** — Google’s API determines if users are eligible to receive proactive notifications via RCS Business Messaging.
* **Rich Conversation capabilities** — High-resolution photos, content carousels, rich cards, quick replies, GIFs, audio messaging and more provide an enriched messaging experience for consumers.
* **No integration** — Google RCS Business Messenger is enabled inside of Android Messages, Google’s default SMS app.
* **Verification** — Businesses get a checkmark on their profile to show that they are verified, and their full brand name will be displayed.
* **Custom branding** — Brands can customize the look and feel of the messaging interface to suit their business.
* **Secure forms** — Secure forms allow brands to perform identification and authorization, share PII information to generate leads or to perform a registration process during a conversation in a PCI compliant environment.
* **Auto messages** — Send predefined messages about events that occur automatically in the conversation.
* **Post Conversation Survey** — Gather feedback from consumers and measure their success across all messaging channels with the Post Conversation Survey.
