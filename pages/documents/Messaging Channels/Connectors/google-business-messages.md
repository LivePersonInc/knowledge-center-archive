## Introduction

Google Business Messaging allows brands to leverage Google’s dominant 92% market share for online searches and empowers consumers to seamlessly initiate a conversation via a rich, secure messaging experience on a platform native to Android users. Additionally, both iOS and Android users can initiate conversations via location search in the Google Maps application. Consumers can use GBM to inquire about in-store stock, schedule appointments, make reservations, and receive excellent customer service.
