In the emerging world of social media, it’s becoming increasingly costly and difficult for brands to manage their customer engagement at scale. Social Messaging extends LivePerson’s conversational commerce platform into the world of social media making it easier for brands to interact with consumers over Twitter and Facebook through a single platform, the Conversational Cloud.  
For each new channel, conversations can take place both in public (Twitter Tweet that mention the brand and Facebook Page posts and comments), in private (Twitter DMs and Facebook Messenger), or a mix of public and private message in the same conversation.

This new functionality is built on top of the Conversational Cloud platform so all existing messaging functionality, including reporting and AI capabilities will work out of the box.  In addition to enabling new communication channels, Social Messaging 2.0 will include the introduction of a new Social Messaging widget to provide additional context from the native platform.

## Why brands should use Social Messaging

With Social Messaging, brands can gain operational efficiencies by consolidating their digital customer care into a single tool, the Conversational Cloud. Social Messaging expands the Conversational Cloud to the most popular social media channels, enabling brands to respond to customers on messaging and social channels. It also reduces operational overhead by simplifying training, and shift management. Finally, Social Messaging applies the power of Conversational Cloud reporting, analytics, automations and artificial intelligence to brand’s social care.
