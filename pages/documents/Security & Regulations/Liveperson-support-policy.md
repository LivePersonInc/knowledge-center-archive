## Severity Definitions and Service Levels

Upon request, Customer will promptly provide LivePerson with full cooperation and all information reasonably requested by LivePerson to facilitate the investigation of all support issues (e.g., test account information, user ID's, access to Customer’s mobile application etc.). Customer acknowledges that its inability to provide all requested information by LivePerson may affect the time periods set forth below and LivePerson shall not be in breach of its obligations herein or be responsible for such delays.

## Service Related Updates 

LivePerson provides service incident notifications and maintenance activity updates on the LivePerson Service Status [Dashboard](https://status.liveperson.com/). 

LivePerson maintains an Emergency Contact distribution list of customers for communicating special notifications (such as daylight savings time updates, etc.). Communications regarding these special notifications are provided via email to the customer’s emergency contacts. The customer is required to submit contact information, including an email, of a designated emergency contact, in order to receive such special notifications from LivePerson.

Notes: 

* LivePerson Customer Support requires each customer to provide an email address of at least one emergency contact, in case we need to contact you. 
* It is the responsibility of the customer to notify LivePerson Customer Support of all changes to their emergency contact(s). LivePerson strongly recommends that the customer establish a single global email address (distribution list) for emergency contacts. 
* We recommend adding support@liveperson.com to your organizational mail server’s safe senders list to ensure that you receive e-mails from us.
