## What is HIPAA?

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted by Congress in 1996. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) was enacted in 2009. Together, the two laws specify requirements for the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI) and apply to all healthcare providers, payers, their business associates, and subcontractors. The laws also establish strict civil and criminal penalties for breaches of PHI and additional steps healthcare organizations must take to respond to breaches.

HIPAA-HITECH apply to “covered entities”, which include **_doctors, hospitals, health insurance companies and other healthcare providers_**. HIPAA’s Omnibus Rule, which went into effect in 2013, extends the law to include all business associates of covered entities. These include health information organizations, e-prescribing gateways, and **_any other entity that provides data transmission services to a covered entity _**or provides personal health records on behalf of a covered entity and who requires access on a routine basis to PHI. In addition, **_all subcontractors of the business associates and covered entities must comply with HIPAA-HITECH if they access PHI of the covered entity_**. Finally, the Omnibus Rule requires any individual who creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a covered entity to comply with HIPAA-HITECH.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the entity responsible for HIPAA, does not require or formally recognize any HIPAA certification programs for CSPs.  

What you want is a CSP that has the necessary controls and processes in place to comply with the HIPAA requirements for which it is responsible

2. Implement policies for secure removal of ePHI before device/media can be re-used
3. Keep a record of movement of devices/media containing ePHI and any person responsible for it
4.  Backup ePHI, when needed, before movement of equipment

* **Security Awareness & Training:** Guard and report malicious software. Monitor logins and provide regular training to employees with access to PHI
* **Security Incident Procedures:** Identify, document, and respond to security incidents
* **Contingency Plan:** Make backups of all ePHI, and implement process for continued protection of ePHI during emergencies
* **Evaluation:** Periodic evaluation of HIPAA to ensure continued compliance
* **BAA:** Sign agreements with partners ensuring they follow HIPAA
