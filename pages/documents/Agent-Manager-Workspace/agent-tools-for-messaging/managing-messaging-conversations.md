Once you start handling conversations, you should move down the conversation list according to priority. Once you handle a customer, more customers can come in, and when you finish the conversation you will be taken to the next conversation in the list.

## Taking incoming conversations

As outlined in the ‘behind the scenes’ section , conversations that reach your workplace have already undergone detailed analysis and prioritization. Each incoming conversation is relevant and fresh for you to answer. Based on the configurations selected by you contact center manager, there are two ways to accept incoming conversations into your workspace:

* **Auto-accept mode**: This means conversations will automatically enter your list without any action on your end, and your My Conversations list will automatically update with new conversations. This is a more popular configuration for call centers.
* **Advanced mode**: For this option, incoming messages will ‘ring’ in your workspace and you’ll have to manually click to open and move this conversation to your My Conversations list. If you do not click to accept an incoming conversation and other agents are available, it will circle and ring to other available agents.
* **Manual mode (Ring All Agents)**: This option means a conversation will ring all online agents simultaneously when an incoming messaging conversation comes into the Conversational Cloud.  Given 2 agents answer at the same time, an indication to a “losing” agent after one was assigned.

## Understanding the context & history

There are several tools in place to help you access the information you’ll need to provide excellent service and understand your consumers and their intent.

* **Conversation History:** For repeat customers, any previous messaging history will display in the Conversation History widget.
* **Consumer Info**: This widget automatically displays important information about the consumer who is messaging you. This information will include the source channel of the conversation or any custom variables collected by your contact center.
* **Bot transfers**: If the conversation began with a bot before it was transferred to you, you will be able to see this in a dedicated section called “bot conversation recap.” You’ll be able to see the escalation reason, the intents identified by the bot and of course the conversation transcript.
* **Custom widgets** - Look at relevant widgets your brand may have built. You may also have customized widgets for your brand that should be used such as CRM integrations or any other customized widgets. Learn more about custom widgets here.

## Replying to consumers

You can reply by using free text, but we recommend using predefined content. Your contact center manager would have created a set of quick answers to the most common inquiries that you can easily enter into the conversation. By choosing predefined content templates, you can lower your average response time by saving time that would have been spent typing out responses. Some predefined answers will have associated hotkeys that will enable you to enter responses even more easily.

## Capturing notes within the conversation summary

Conversation Summary is a dedicated widget that enables you write notes and comments about the conversation. Since the connection may be ongoing, these notes will help you quickly catch up on the conversation and keep other agents in the loop should it be assigned to them in the future.

## Conversation actions

While conducting a conversation, there are a few actions you can take:

**Transfer Conversation:** Select a skill to transfer your conversation to. Use the search bar to find the relevant skill. Once you do this, the conversation will move out of your workspace and enter that skill’s queue.

**Hide conversation**: If you have an inactive conversation that doesn’t require your attention, this option allows you to hide the conversation window and send the conversation back to Open Conversations.

**Copy as plain text**: This action opens a window that includes that text of the conversation that can be copied to anywhere you need, such as into a CRM record.

## Adjusting the SLA for follow up

Every time a consumer sends a message, the SLA, or your expected time to reply resets. For example, if you are expected to respond within 1 minute, each time a consumer answers a message the one minute will start over and the conversation will be prioritized automatically and adjusted appropriately in your [All Conversations](agent-manager-workspace-manager-tools-for-messaging-all-connections.html) list.

As an agent, you are able to control the amount of time you need to reply to consumers manually. For example, if you are chatting with a customer and you need to check the status on their application, you can let the customer know that you’ll get back to them in a couple of hours and then manually adjust the SLA of this conversation. By doing so, it will appear in your queue in the appropriate time and remind you to follow up with the customer.

## Use Rich Conversations to make your conversations more engaging

There are many tools at your disposal that can be used to foster relationships and carry out effective conversations. Rich Conversations enhance the the consumer experience by providing a richer, more engaging channel of communication.

### Emojis

Both you and the consumers can utilize emojis within the conversation. While consumers have the full array of emojis available, the ones at the agents disposal are more selective. The emojis available to you are ones that can be construed as professional and relevant to business conversations. Please refer to your brand guidelines and language to determine which emojis are appropriate and how often and when to use them.

### Rich Conversations

For most channels, Rich Conversation capabilities such as carousels and quick replies are available. Based on your contact center set up, you may have custom widgets are your disposal that enable you to send product catalogues, images or other rich content.

Refer to guidelines from your manager as to what tools are available to you. For a reference list of the Rich Conversation capabilities that are available by messaging channel, [click here](messaging-channels-messaging-channels-capabilities-comparison.html).

### View the customer’s screen using CoBrowse

For cases when you can better assist the consumer by viewing their screen, you can start a CoBrowse session with them. This will enable you to view their browser, move their mouse, highlight areas of their screen to provide better service. If you have the appropriate permissions, you can also take over the mouse and fill in forms on their behalf. [Click here](agent-manager-workspace-agent-tools-for-messaging-cobrowse-for-messaging.html) to learn more about CoBrowse.

## Closing conversations

The nature of messaging conversations is that they are ongoing and can be resumed at anytime. However, in order to manage agent work streams and ensure consumer requests have been fulfilled, conversations can be marked as ‘closed.’ A closed conversation can be reopened again - either by the consumer or by the agent - with the entire history kept intact.

The conversations can be marked as resolved or closed, either by the consumer or the agent. Within the conversation window, customers have ‘options’, one of which is to select to closed a conversation. For messaging channels such as SMS or Facebook Messenger, where a custom ‘options’ table is not available, customers will not be able to mark conversations as closed.

As an agent, you can close a conversation when you know that it has been resolved. Closing a conversation is done via the drop down menu within the conversation window.

{: .notice}
It is important that you close conversations as soon as you are confident that they are resolved in order to clear your work queue and keep your performance KPIs accurate._

**Auto Close for inactive conversations**

For conversations that are awaiting a consumer response, the auto close mechanism will automatically close these conversations after a length of time that has been defined by your contact center manager. Conversations will not be subject to auto close if they are pending an agent’s reply or if you have set up a manual SLA. Learn more about auto close for messaging [here](contact-center-management-messaging-operations-auto-close-for-messaging-conversations.html).

**What happens when a conversation is closed?**

Upon the closing of a conversation (whether done by the customer, the agent or automatically) the [Post Conversation Survey](ai-bots-automation-post-conversation-survey-bot.html) will be triggered to the customer (as defined by your brand). This survey is comprised of CSAT, NPS or other custom questions.

The CSAT scores calculated for your performance in the KPI bar are derived from results calculated from the post-conversation survey.
