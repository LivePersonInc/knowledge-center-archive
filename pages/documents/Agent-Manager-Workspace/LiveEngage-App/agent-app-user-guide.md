The LivePerson Agent app is available for both iOS & Android that allows agents and agent managers to message with consumers on-the-go. The current app offers simple messaging capabilities and can help agents that are working from home to continue to provide services to their consumers.

In addition to allowing reps to work remotely, the app also expands opportunities for messaging scenarios. For example, in stores, retail reps can leverage their down time by messaging with customers not in store, utilizing retail reps as agents and giving them the power to increase sales.

## Agent flow
### Empty state
The first time the agent logs in to the app it appears to be in an empty state. This is because the agent has no assigned conversations and no new conversation ringing. All agent’s conversations were ended (either manually or automatically).
Agents can open the drawer menu by tapping their picture on the top left corner. The small dot represents their current state: green for online, red for away.

### New ring alert
New conversation ringing (ACD manual accept mode only)

![](img/V1-Android-agent-app-3.png)

### Accepting the conversation
Tapping the "accept" button assigns the conversation to the agent and opens the conversation. Tapping accept opens only 1 conversation at a time, even if there are multiple conversations ringing for the agent.

### Ignoring the conversation
An agent can ignore ringing conversations. After a preset time (the default is 1m), the conversation will move to the next available agent (as decided by LivePerson’s agent availability algorithm).

{: .notice}
The app filters out conversations with unassigned skills. Unassigned skill conversations will not be received in the agent app.

### Conversation top bar
**Consumer avatar:** From sources such as SMS, the consumer avatar doesn’t appear, therefore a generic avatar is used for aesthetic reasons. If the source supports a consumer avatar, such as Facebook, the consumer avatar is shown.

### Conversation list entry

**Consumer avatar:** From sources such as SMS, the consumer avatar doesn’t appear, therefore a generic avatar is used for aesthetic reasons. If the source supports a consumer avatar, such as Facebook, the consumer avatar is shown.

**Consumer ID:** The key information indicator for the consumer. The ID usually contains the consumer’s name. When using SMS, the consumer ID is their phone number.

**Last message excerpt:** Displays the last conversation message excerpt.
The list entry also display conversation response time indication (see connections list slide)

### Conversation message
Every conversation starts with a new message, originating from the consumer.

## Messaging the consumer
### Text field
When the agent writes several lines or uses the ‘return’ key it sends the message.

### Send icon
Tapping the send icon adds the text to the conversation and sends it to the consumer.

![](img/ConversationScreen.png) 

### Attachments Icon

ADD attachments.png

### Conversation message: consumer side
Consumer side conversation messages appear with a color background. Every conversation is color-coded for easy identification by the agent. Below the consumer bubble there is time stamp.

### Conversation message: agent side
Agent side conversation messages appear with a white background.
Below the agent bubble there is an indication for the agent name and a time stamp. In addition there is a message status icon “v” indication: sent, delivered and read (similar to the whatsApp indications).

### Auto messages/system messages
Automatic messages or system messages display in a white color without a bubble centered in the screen.

## Agent action menu
Tapping the three vertical dots on the top right brings up the agent action menu.

### Return to queue
Tapping the ‘return to queue’ action removes the agent assignment from the conversation and sends it back to the queue of the appropriate skill. The position of the conversation in the queue is determined by LivePerson’s algorithm (currently it is positioned at the end of the queue, but enhancements to the algorithm are in progress).

### Close conversation
In case the conversation is no longer relevant and is not needed for future reference, the agent may close the conversation. This hides the conversation from the list and it can subsequently only be accessed via Agent manager or from web. On web, closed conversations can be reopened when the agent sends a new message. 

### Inactive conversations
Inactive conversations can be closed automatically using the Auto-close feature. This feature closes conversations after a configurable time during which the consumer has been idle. Contact your LivePerson account team to configure this feature.

### Transfer conversations
Allow agent to transfer a conversation either to another agent or to any agent within a skill.

![](img/Actions1.png)

## The connections list
### Connection list order
The agent usually sees multiple conversations on their conversation list. Every conversation is color-coded for easy identification by the agent. The color-code can be seen on the outer ring of each consumer avatar.
The list is sorted according to the response time (SLA). If there is no response time because the conversation is pending a consumer response, then the list is sorted according to last modified conversation by the agent (top to bottom).

### The dynamic list behavior and transition
When the conversation status changes, e.g. when an agent responds to an overdue conversation, the position of the conversation in the queue changes accordingly.

{: .notice}
Agents can see closed conversations for 1 day under the 'My' tab and can search for closed conversation up to 90 days under the 'All' tab.

### Conversation list indications
Conversations pending an agent response have response time indications on right side. In the case where a conversation is overdue (at the top according to sorting logic), a red bell icon is displayed
The app filters out conversations with unassigned skills. Unassigned skill conversations will not be displayed in the connections list.

## Notifications
### Push notifications
When the agent moves the app to the background, new conversation are received as push notifications. Each push include a generic message that a new conversation is waiting to be accepted.
Each push notification includes:
- Customer ID: showing the name (or phone number) of the consumer who sent the new message.
- Message excerpt: a short excerpt of the new message.
- Tapping the notification: opens the app and focuses on the relevant conversation’s last message.

![](img/V1-Android-agent-app-6.png)

## Logout
### Return conversation to queue when logging out
When a user is trying to log out of the app, if he has open conversations assigned to him, an alert message will be prompted.
User can choose between three options:
- Automatically return all his assigned open conversations back to queue and logout
- Logging out without returning the conversation back to queue
- Cancel - the user will not be logged out and return to previous screen.

## Manager Flow
### The Agent Manager Capabilities

{: . noitce}
All of the functionality for agent users apply to agent manager as well.

In order for a manager to be able to receive new conversation, he needs to be defined in the web platform with an agent role.
Below describes the additional set of features available only for users with manager role:

### The manager connections view - My/All tabs
When a user with a manager role logs in to the app, the connections list display two tabs: My/All.
Under the my tab, managers can view open conversation assigned to him or conversations that he is joined to.

### Assigned agent name
In each conversation entry, there is an indication of the assigned agent

### Join conversation icon
There is a “join” icon for the conversation that the manager is joined to

### The ‘All’ tab connections list
In the ‘All’ tab, managers can view:
- Open conversations assigned to the agent he is managing (in his agent group)
- Open conversations in queue - manager can view conversations in queue (not assigned to any agent). The manager can only view in queue conversations assigned to a skill which at least one of the agents are assigned to
- Close conversation - manager can view closed conversations that were assigned to agents he manages.

The list displays closed conversations from the past 14 days (from conversation start date).
The list order is similar to the logic explained for the agents list order (see above). Closed conversations are displayed at the bottom and sorted according to the closing date (recently closed at the top).

{: .notice}
The app filters out conversations with unassigned skill. Unassigned skill conversation will not be visible in the my/all tab list.
