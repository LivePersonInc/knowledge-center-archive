In order to protect your online security and the safety of your agents, it may become necessary on occasion to block an IP address, or a group of IP addresses. For example, if your platform is being attacked by malicious software or if your agents are having trouble with abusive customers.

By creating a target audience excluding a specific IP address or set of addresses, engagements will not be visible to users of those addresses and they will not have the option to chat.

A target audience can also be created with the inclusion of specific IP addresses. For example, if you have created a test environment and want to ensure that only people from within your team have access to the engagement.

To exclude/include an IP address(es):

1. In the Campaign Builder, click **add campaign**.
2. Give your campaign a name and add a goal.
3. Under **target audience**, click edit.
4. In target audience library, click **add new**.
5. Give the target audience a name.
6. On the left-hand side options bar, click on **IP range**.
7. Here you have the option of including or excluding IP addresses:
   * To include an IP address or range of addresses, click **include IP range** and enter addresses. To include only one address, enter it twice.
   * To exclude an IP address or range of addresses, enter addresses in the **exclude IP range** area. To include only one address, enter it twice.
   * Additional addresses or ranges can be added by clicking **add IP range**.
8. Click **save**.
