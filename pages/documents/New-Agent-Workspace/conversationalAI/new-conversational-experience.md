As part of our effort to enhance and simplify operations with LivePerson, we have created a new **Conversational AI** view. This view centralizes all of LivePerson's automation products, allowing both agents and account administrators to access all the tools they need to set up, configure, and enable our powerful AI features for their account. This new view replaces the previous **Automation** view and includes all the previous options it displayed and much more!

## The Conversational AI view

By clicking on the relevant icon from the left hand sidebar, you will be able to pull up the Conversational AI view. If your account is enabled with our automation features, you will see a list of all the different AI features and products which LivePerson offers. Otherwise, you will see a short explanation on these features alongside a video.

You'll notice that some of these features have a lock icon besides them. This means that your account has not enabled this specific feature. If you're an administrator of this account, you'll be prompted to message us. Our team will be happy to help you unlock and configure any of these features via the Connection Area, right within your account.

Features and products that are unlocked will be clickable, allowing you to easily navigate to the various product included in our Conversational AI suite. These are:

* **Conversation Builder** - LivePerson's powerful tool for setting up and building bots.

* **Knowledge Base** - a tool allowing you to connect extensive Knowledge Bases to your Conversation Builder bots.

* **Accounts** - manage your account's users and access permissions to AI features and products.

* **Intent Builder** - a tool allowing you to build and manage powerful intents, which augment and work alongside with the Conversation Builder's bots.

* **Bot Analytics** - in-depth analytics on your bots' performance, including conversion rates and number of interactions.

* **Intent Analyzer** - setup real-time intent detection and browse detailed intent dashboards.

* **Conversation Orchestrator** - configure Conversation Orchestrator's AI engine to orchestrate all conversations and automations.

* **Third-Party Bots** - Integrate bots created on a platform other than the Conversation Builder with the Conversational Cloud.
