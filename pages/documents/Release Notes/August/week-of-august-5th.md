New “Horizon” theme is added to the Engagement Window Library. The Horizon theme will become the default engagement window, replacing the Ocean theme:

* New LiveEngage accounts will have Horizon theme as their default window.
* For existing accounts there will be no impact on existing engagements and windows. The new default will take place only once the campaign manager / admin creates a new window or a new engagement.
* Existing accounts can proactively change their existing engagements to work with the new Horizon theme, if they wish to.
* The Ocean theme will still be available in the Engagement Window Library for both new and existing accounts, in case they prefer to use it as is or as their starting point for creating new windows.

Horizon theme comprises of the following features (that are different from the Ocean theme):

* Large window
* New image at the header
* Chevron minimize icon
* Top bar icon is set to "round bubble outline"
* Top window corners radius is bigger
* Agent and consumer bubble style is set to "three corner rounded"
* Consumer bubble with visual read indication (relevant only for messaging)
* Consumer bubble border is blue
* Text area is light gray
* Window is closed automatically once consumer ends conversation, or upon submitting the post chat / conversation survey, if applicable.

The Horizon theme will be the default for both chat and web messaging engagements and will impact desktop and mobile experiences. In order to modify this theme, brands can use the “Add new” option on the Engagement Window Library. Brands can still use the Ocean theme as their starting point by using the Duplicate option from the action menu.

Brands now have the ability to choose 2 new invitation templates from the engagement template gallery. These new invitation templates are added to Type = Conversation, Format = Sticky, Use case = General, Size = 120x28px gallery. The new “message us” invitation template, is now the default invitation for new accounts and for existing ones while creating new engagement. No impact on existing engagement of existing customers.

The previous “Live Chat” template is still available on the gallery, in case customers would like to use it as is or as a starting point for modifications.

The 2 new templates are:

* A new “Message us” bubble with rounded corners and editable text - this will be the new default, replacing the “Live Chat” invitation.
* A new round bubble invitation (without text), located by default at the right bottom corner of the webpage.

## Google Business Messaging - Onboarding Page

### Type: New functionality

We are adding a Google Business Messaging connector into the self-service Data Source > Conversations Sources area, to accompany WhatsApp, FB Messenger, Twilio, etc.

Messaging clients will now be able to go through a more automated process for submitting their early adopter request to Google, including agreement to terms and policies, and providing brand and contact information. The information will first be verified internally by LivePerson then coordinated with Google for set up if the brand is a fit.

The new connector will guide them through the application process, and they will be able to view their status update from pending to approved to live.

**How to enable:** The Google Business Messaging Conversation Source will be enabled automatically for all messaging clients.

**Limitations:** The submission of business requirements is the first step in going live with Google Business Messaging. There are still manual configuration steps performed by LivePerson in conjunction with Google to bring brands live on the solution. Please speak with your LivePerson account team for more information.
