## New skill-based efficiency metrics in API

The reality of messaging conversations today is that 50% of interactions with customers are transferred between skills. Most of these transfers arise from bot escalations, but the long term nature of messaging conversations can also elicit transfers between human skills. Currently, when measuring the performance of conversations with multiple skills, the metrics of a particular skill may reflect another skill's performance.  This month LivePerson has introduced a new segmentation model to measure each individual skill performance and present accurate KPIs per skill. This allows for improved reporting and more accurate data. These metrics have been added to the Realtime Messaging Operations API.

## Queue visibility

#### Visualize queues to understand workload

Agents and agent managers will be able to better understand the state of the queue and how much work awaits a team of agents. New metrics will show you the number of actionable conversations in queue per skill which will help you to make decisions regarding shifts accordingly. These metrics will be available to you by default and you’ll see them in the KPI bar built into LivePerson agent workspace - as well as in the accompanying real time dashboard.

## Queue prioritization

#### Prioritize conversations in queues based on importance

Conversations within queues will be prioritized based on importance using enhanced logic and infrastructure, including the ability to define additional rules and  parameters to the prioritization calculations. For example, if a conversation was transferred more than twice or was transferred from a specific skill, this conversation can advance faster in the queue. See [Queue Prioritization for Messaging](contact-center-management-messaging-operations-queue-management-queue-prioritization-overview.html) for more information

## Support for Post Conversation Survey via In-app Messaging SDK v3.3

In-app Messaging SDK Version 3.3 was launched this October and supports the [Post Conversation Survey](Bots-automation-post-conversation-survey.html) on iOS and Android. The post conversation has been a big hit with many of our customers as it allows you to collect feedback from consumers at the end of a conversation, measuring agent and skill performance by delivering surveys in a conversational experience. See the Developers Community for more details on [Android](https://developers.liveperson.com/mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-android-latest-release-notes.html#post-content) and [iOS](https://developers.liveperson.com/mobile-app-messaging-sdk-for-android-latest-release-notes.html#post-content).

## New Report Builder & messaging dashboard metrics

The Report Builder and Messaging Dashboards have been updated with new metrics.  The agent load KPI gives agent managers a view of how productive their agents are and whether their agents are over or under capacity in order to help agent optimization. New Conversion Metrics in the Messaging Performance Dashboard allows you to analyze sales results together with messaging operations data. See [Operational Reporting Metrics](data-reporting-messaging-messaging-dashboards-messaging-performance-dashboard.html) for more details

## Google My Business and AdWords Connectors

#### Now with Google API GA

The Google Ads and Google My Business (GMB) Connectors have been updated with the Google upgrade of their APIs from beta to GA.  Through these connectors, you can perform mass on-boarding to GMB locations allowing brands to message consumers from Google Ads or Google My Business entry points. See [Google My Business](messaging-channels-google-my-business.html) article for more information.
