Here is a round-up of the latest features, enhancements and enablements that are coming to LivePerson September 2018.

## Resume closed conversations

### An easy way to follow up with consumers

This month we are excited to introduce the Resume conversation feature which enables you to engage customers by **resuming conversations** even after the conversation has been closed. Previously, the time frame limit to resume a conversation was just 14 days but now it is 13 months which is the full time period that LivePerson stores conversation transcripts. This is ideal for agents who want to follow up on a conversation to ensure that your consumers issue was resolved.

## Post Conversation Survey

#### Collect customer feedback after the conversation ends

The [Post Conversation Survey](bots-automation-post-conversation-survey.html) was officially launched this month and delivers surveys in a conversational experience to drive higher completion rates. The PCS enables you to measure agent and skill performance and to identify opportunities to improve on quality targets. The survey is automatically triggered at the end of a conversation with a consumer, without utilizing the time of a human agent. The bot can ask specialized questions and is designed to provide CSAT, FCR and NPS metrics as well as Open ended questions.

Enhanced reporting will allow you to analyze the activity generated by the Post Conversation bot and the responses submitted by consumers (submission rates, response rates for each question). The Post Conversation Survey is currently available  for web messaging and will be ready for in-app, Facebook, ABC and SMS by the end of the month. See the [Post Conversation Survey](bots-automation-post-conversation-survey.html) guide for more information.

## Queue prioritization

#### Prioritize conversations in queues based on importance

Handling incoming messaging and allocating staff accordingly is now even more efficient allowing you to prioritize conversations in queues based on importance and likelihood of response

Queues will be prioritized based on importance using enhanced logic and infrastructure, including the ability to add additional parameters to the prioritization calculations. For example, you will be able to define the criteria that bring consumers to the front of the queue, such as VIP customers. See [Queue Prioritization for Messaging](contact-center-management-messaging-operations-queue-management-queue-prioritization-overview.html) for more information.

## Queue Visibility

#### Visualize queues to understand workload

Agent and agent managers will be able to better understand the state of the queue and how much work awaits a team of agents.  New metrics will show you the number of actionable conversations in queue per skill which will help you to make decisions regarding shifts accordingly.

These metrics will be available by default and will be built into LivePerson agent workspace.

## Flexible campaign scheduling

Campaign scheduling gives you the ability to be more flexible and precise in selecting the hours that the chat or messaging button appears on the website.

LivePerson’s current [campaign timeframe management](contact-center-management-campaigns-time-frame.html) only supports the option to define the campaign’s start date and end date, with no option to change the active hours per each day of the week. Campaign scheduling will give you maximum flexibility with the option to control campaign availability based on operational hours. See [Campaigns Overview](contact-center-management-campaigns-campaigns-overview.html) for more information.

## Sensitive historic data instantly masked for agents

LivePerson automatically masks credit card numbers by default and now allows you to define additional sensitive data patterns for masking. Data from conversations will appear masked for the agent from the moment the conversation is closed.

## Automate dynamic tex in predefined content

Admins can set up dynamic text (macros), such as agent name or skill name, within predefined content templates for messaging conversations. This increases agent productivity and minimizes errors as agents can automate text that they use time and time again.

## Use Apple Pay directly from within a conversation

Using Apple Business Chat you can now increase direct sales and offer more service transactions directly from a conversation. Support for Apple Pay allows agents to directly share Apple Pay requests. Once an Apple Pay request is received by a consumer, they can authenticate and pay.

## Authenticated Interactive Message

#### Use in-conversation authentication via ABC

The new Apple Business Chat authenticated interactive message enables you to authenticate consumers within the conversation window. The authentication messages can be shared by agents via the structured content framework, and will be out of the box and supported for consumers in iOS 12 release.

We have some new updates the to [MCS Toolkit](data-reporting-meaningful-connection-score-(mcs)-meaningful-connection-score-(mcs)-overview.html)**.** You can [use your MCS Toolkit](data-reporting-meaningful-connection-score-(mcs)-using-the-mcs-toolkit.html) alongside LivePerson with the same login. Post conversation survey questions and answers will be added to the existing Conversation Export feature (CSV) of MCS Toolkit.

## Real time dashboard enhancements

Your [real time dashboard](data-reporting-messaging-real-time-data-real-time-data-for-messaging.html) has been improved with alerts and threshold settings. When configuring Thresholds in the RTD settings for a given section, a new option will allow the brand to select between “more than” or “less than” a given input target (instead of just the single option “more than”). You can also use your dashboard alongside LivePerson with the same login.
