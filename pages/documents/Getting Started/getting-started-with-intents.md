The vision of the intent-driven business is to fundamentally change how brands understand and act on what their consumers want and need - not through proxies like website click patterns - but with consumers’ own intents. LivePerson’s Intent Analyzer allows you to do this and you can get up and running very quickly with Prebuilt Domains.

## What is the LivePerson Intent Analyzer?

The Intent Manager accurately understands what consumers want. It empowers brands to build an intent taxonomy, analyze the most popular consumer intents, optimize how well they are being fulfilled, and discover intents that can or should be automated. The Intent Manager is made up of the Intent Builder and the LivePerson Intent Analyzer.

Intent Manager’s proprietary natural language understanding (NLU) engine extracts consumer intents at every turn of the conversation. Intent Manager comes pre-configured for a variety of industries, to automatically understand a high percentage of consumer intents entirely out of the box. It offers flexibility for data scientists, content creators, and non-technical employees to fine-tune or configure custom intents from a simple interface.

Real-time intent data empowers brands to make important business policy, process, and product-related decisions, and to automate a high percentage of consumer interactions when used in conjunction with LivePerson’s Conversation Builder.

### Step 2: Create a domain by selecting a prebuilt domain

There are currently 4 industry-specific domains: Telecommunications, Financial services, Airlines, and Insurance; there is also a generic domain called Cross-vertical. Cross vertical is a good starting point to see how the tool works especially if your business doesn't fit into any of the other categories.
