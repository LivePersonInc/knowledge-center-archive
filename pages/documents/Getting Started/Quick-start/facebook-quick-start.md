Connect Facebook Messenger to LiveEngage.

## Requirements:

2. Download the Facebook Messenger App:  [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/messenger/id454638411) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&hl=en).

## Step 1: Setup Facebook Messenger as a Data Source

Login to [LiveEngage](https://authentication.liveperson.net/) and click the **Campaigns** tab at the top of your screen. Click on **Data Sources** in the Campaigns footnote.

2. You will then be prompted with the question: "What is LP on Messenger (VA1) allowed to do?" Leave the toggles as is and click **Done.**
3. You will receive the confirmation message: _"You’ve now linked LP on Messenger (VA1) to Facebook"_. Click on **OK** to close this window.
4. A small pop-up within LiveEngage will appear asking you to Subscribe. Subscribe the relevant Facebook pages (the same ones you gave permissions to earlier) and click on **Done**.
