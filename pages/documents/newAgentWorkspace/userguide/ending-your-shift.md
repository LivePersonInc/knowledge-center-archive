## Before you take a break

* Set your status to away so that you do not have new incoming conversations assigned to you. If there are multiple away states displayed in your status menu, select the most appropriate one.
* Don’t leave conversations waiting. If you have any active conversations, you can take one of these two actions:
    * Let each customer know that you will get back to them in x amount of time and set the manual SLA to reflect this commitment
    * Return conversations to queue so that another agent will be able to answer the consumer (you can leave notes to help your colleagues in the summary section)

## Before you leave for the day

* Set your status to away about 10 minutes before you are ready to leave so that you do not receive new incoming conversations (refer to your company’s manual on guidance for the accurate amount of time  in advance)
* Review your open conversations and resolve the ones that can be closed
* Determine which conversations you want to continue servicing the next day, let the customers know, and manually set the SLA for the next day
* For conversations that should continue immediately - return them to the queue so that another agent will be able to answer the consumer (you can leave notes to help your colleagues in the summary section)
* Filter closed conversations into the list to review the conversations you handled during the shift and ensure that everything has been documented properly
