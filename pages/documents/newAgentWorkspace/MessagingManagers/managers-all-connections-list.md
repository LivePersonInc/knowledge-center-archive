The All Connections tab displays every one of your brand’s messaging conversations, both open and closed, that have began in the past 13 months. This area is a useful tool that features advanced filtering and search capabilities, which lead to meaningful analysis on business topics, consumer satisfaction, and operational effectiveness. Transcripts are available in near real-time, so managers can track and analyze conversations.  including for survey answers to open questions. All Connections allows agent managers to view the entire flow of a conversation, including transfers to another agent or skill, offering them a detailed understanding of the consumer experience and agent performance.

## Definitions
All Connections includes the following information:

* **Status** - the status of the conversation, whether active or closed
* **Consumer name** - the consumer’s name as recorded in the pre-chat survey
* **MCS** - the Meaningful Connection Score with a smiley, available for English language text analysis
* **Skill** - the skill assigned to the conversation
* **Agent name** - the name of the agent(s) assigned to the conversation; due to the continuous nature of messaging conversations, it is likely that more than one agent will have been active in conversation with the consumer over time
* **Agent group** - the agent group that the agent(s) assigned to the conversation belong to
* **Last message time** - the time the last message was sent, by either the agent or consumer, in the conversation
* **Start** - the time the visitor first started a conversation with the agent (displayed in the visitor’s local time), or the time the agent resumed the conversation with the consumer
* **Duration** - the time frame between when the consumer started the conversation until it was ended by either the consumer or the agent; or active conversations, the duration displayed here represents the time from the start of the conversation until the moment this data is viewed

## Search and filter
**Pre-filtered connections:** The All Connections page is pre-filtered. Agent managers are able to view conversations handled by agents in the agent groups they manage, as well as unassigned conversations that have a skill assigned to one of the agents they manage in the All Connections list. Other unassigned conversations will not be displayed. For example, an unassigned conversation with the sales skill is waiting in the queue. The agent manager has several agents with the sales skill and will therefore see the unassigned conversation, while other agent managers who do not manage agents with this skill will not see it.

Agents on the other hand are able to view only the conversations for which they were the last assigned agent (and are unable to view unassigned conversations).

**Search and filter:** All Connections offers advanced filtering and search capabilities that can provide in-depth, meaningful analysis on key topics for your business, consumer sentiment and the operational effectiveness of your contact center.

**Agents and agent managers can search/filter conversations with the following parameters:**
* Keywords from transcripts
* Duration of conversation
* Agent
* Agent group
* Skill
* Start time
* Status (open and closed)
* Meaningful Connection Score (MCS)
* Conversation ID
* CSAT
* Summary keywords
* Engagement Attribute keywords

**For example:** An agent manager can filter conversations by duration. By drilling down further and refining the search, they will be able to pinpoint why the conversations had an abnormal length. Managers can also view all conversations with a low MCS, or a low CSAT, and identify the cause by referring to the conversation transcripts.
