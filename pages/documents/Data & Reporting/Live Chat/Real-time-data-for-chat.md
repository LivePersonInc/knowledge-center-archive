As an agent manager, you want to have an overall picture of how your agents are performing at any given time. The data bar provides you with a snapshot of the basic information you need to track agent efficiency and operational performance.  
The data bar default view presents aggregated data from all skills (queues) on the account for the last 12 hours.

## Agent real time data bar

The agent data bar enables agents to monitor their own performance data in real time. The agent data bar is displayed above the web visitors list.

As an agent, you have goals to meet, such as achieving a specific customer satisfaction rate or a certain number of engagements per hour.

The data bar displays the following metrics:

**Engagements**

Engagements represents the number of chats you’ve taken during your current shift. The system counts the chat once you close the Engagement window.

**Average engagement length**

The length of your chats varies depending on the type of inquiries you receive. Your chats should be only as long as they need to be to ensure successful resolution of your customer’s issue. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h_L550531uwijhNzlI47Tp77-QwFQT25O-qYjEUci6kvVofY-zYjprKUlZ2anlsHi_DMlty-8v_1OSeFrtWv6spzx8NQssf3BVrMKVj1e2Z3x7pYzrXxz0lat4jaJVp3-Z2E3vWc =398x32)

For example, if you were engaged for a total of 5 hours (including concurrent chats) and in that time took five chats, your average engagement length is:  5 hours / 5 = 1 hour

**Engagements per hour**

For example, if you took six (6) engagements between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. (and you were online during this period of time), your engagements per hour =

**Utilized Capacity**

Utilized Capacity is calculated as follows:

If your utilized capacity is low, then either you are not busy enough, or the volume of chats has decreased. If, on the other hand, your utilized capacity is high, you are fully occupied.    
**CSAT**

Monitor your Data Bar, to make sure that you are meeting your goals. If your utilization and CSAT scores are below par, get help from your manager or your peers.

**Queue health data bar**

The queue health data bar provides a snapshot of the basic information required to track agent efficiency and operational efficiency. The queue health data bar is located above the web visitors list.

The data bar default view presents aggregated data from all skills (queues) on the account for the last 12 hours.

### Metrics

**CONNECTED:** displays the number of connected chats between visitors and agents whether or not they interacted.

**ABANDONED:** displays the number of visitors that left the queue before connecting to an agent. Visitors abandon the queue for a number of reasons; they might just get tired of waiting.

**ABANDON RATE:** displays the percentage of visitors that abandoned the queue out of all visitors that entered the queue. Abandon rates should not exceed 5%.

**AVG TIME TO ABANDON:** displays the average time from the moment visitors enter the queue until they abandon it. Although you don’t have control over this number, it is useful for you to know the average length of time it’s taking for visitors to abandon the queue, so you can take action.

**AVG TIME TO ANSWER**: displays the average time from the moment that visitors enter the queue to the moment they connect with agents. As a rule of thumb, a good average time to answer is between 15 and 30 seconds. If the average time to answer is longer than 30 seconds, for example at peak hours, you may want to consider adding agents to this shift.

According to the data in the data bar, you can offer your agents constructive feedback to help shorten the average time to answer chats and lower the abandon rate, and adjust your staffing accordingly.

**Queue health dashboard (24 hours)**

The queue health dashboard graphically displays real-time and historical data that enables easily evaluation of agent efficiency. To access the queue health dashboard, click the pull-down button above the web visitors list.

The agent list data bar is located above the list of agents.
