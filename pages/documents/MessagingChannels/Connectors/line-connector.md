### Agent to consumer photo sharing

This feature enables agents to share photos with consumers in LINE conversations. The image files will be shared from the local file dialog.

The following file types are supported:
* JPG
* GIF
* JPEG
* PNG

All files types have a file size limitation of 5MB. Agents will get an error if the file is not within this supported list. The file sharing flow, functionality, capabilities and limitations, remain similar to definitions described [here](messaging-channels-rich-messaging-agent-file-sharing-overview.html).
