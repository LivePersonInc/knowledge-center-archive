LivePerson enables you to define your account’s working hours, in order to set the most accurate expected response time for your consumers during a messaging conversation.

You may define your account’s working hours in two ways:

1. **Manual definition (default)** - whenever your contact center starts a shift, manually set the Shift Scheduler to “Online.” Whenever your contact center is closed, manually set the shift scheduler to “Off hours.”
2. **Automatic Scheduler** - define your workdays per day of the week as well as special occasions ahead of time.

You may choose from each of the methods above according to your brand’s needs.

## Terminology

* **SLA** = Service Level Agreement. The response time configured within the Agent Workspace to handle messaging conversations for either all conversations (default), urgent conversations, or first time consumers. The SLA can be set per the account level (default) or be overridden per skill.

  ![](/img/shift-scheduler-CG-1.png)
* **TTR** = Time To Response. This time is set according to the current shift status (online/off hours). If the shift is currently active, the TTR equals 0. If the shift is currently inactive, the TTR equals the time until the next shift will start.
* **ETTR** = Expected Time To Response. The expected response time when the consumer will be answered by an agent. The ETTR is displayed to consumers during a messaging conversation via the Automatic Messages mechanism.  
  ETTR = TTR + SLA.

  **For example:**
* If the default SLA is 1 hour and the account is currently on an active shift, the ETTR = SLA = 1 hour.
* If the default SLA is 1 hour and the account is currently offline, and the next shift will begin in 12 hours from now, the ETTR = 12 + 1 = 13 hours.

## Manual working hours

1. Click the downward arrow next to the user name and click "Shift Scheduler"

   ![](/img/shift-scheduler-CG-2.png)

   {:start="2"}
2. The Account Shift Scheduler screen will now be displayed. Choose the “Manual” option.
3. Define your current shift status:
   1. Choose “Online” when your connection center is active.
      * Consumers will get auto messages with expected time to response equal to the conversation SLA.
   2. Choose “Off hours” when your connection center is inactive.
      * Define the next shift start date
      * Define the next shift start time
      * Consumers will get auto messages with expected time to response equal to the time until next shift time + the conversation SLA.
      * The Conversational Cloud will automatically set to “Online” again on the next shift date and time.
   3. Save the page.

## Automatic scheduler

![](/img/shift-scheduler-CG-3b.png)

The configuration of scheduled [Workdays](https://developers.liveperson.com/workdays-api-overview.html) allows you to set hours of operation for specific days of the week and assign them as the account's default settings or for each individual skill, which overrides the default settings. During the specified hours of operation, consumers will receive working hours **auto messages** and the **expected time to response message** for the skill as defined in the account. Outside of the specified hours of operation, consumers will receive off hours auto messages and the expected time to response including the time until the next shift begins.

The expected time to respond is also available for the agent, so it is clear to him when the consumer is expecting his reply.

The configuration of [Special Occasions](https://developers.liveperson.com/account-configuration-special-occasions-overview.html) allows you to set specific dates in which there is an exception to the hours of operation defined by the Workdays API or through the Conversational Cloud UI, for example, working hours during public holidays. The expected behavior on the visitor side as far as Automatic Messages and time to response is exactly the same as Workdays.  
**Note**: Special occasions do not modify hours of operation defined by Workdays, but instead override them.

**See limitations, clarifications and best practices for** [**working hours management**](contact-center-management-messaging-operations-working-hours-management-best-practices.html)**.**

## Configuration

**(Needed for both API + UI)**

1. Configure [Automatic Messages](contact-center-management-messaging-operations-automatic-messages-automatic-messages-configuration.html) on your account:
   * To enable Automatic Messages on your LivePerson Conversational Cloud account, please contact your LivePerson account team.
2. Mobile App (SDK) customers:
   * Use SDK versions 2.8 or higher.
   * The TTR toaster is no longer supported, even if it’s still enabled. Therefore, it is recommended to turn the TTR toaster message off.
3. In case you are using the “off hours by number of logged in agents” feature - it is recommended to disable it. The working hours feature is the permanent solution to the use case this workaround was intended for.  
   Contact your account team to disable it.
4. Customize Automatic Messages on your account.

## Workdays & special occasions using APIs

### Creating a new workday item

See [Workdays API -> Create Workdays Object](https://developers.liveperson.com/account-configuration-workdays-create.html) on the Developer Center.

### Creating a new special occasion item

See [Special Occasion API -> Create Special Occasion Object](https://developers.liveperson.com/account-configuration-special-occasions-create.html) on the Developer Center.

### Assigning workdays/special occasions per account

The **“isDefault”** field determines whether a workdays object is the default for the entire account. Only one object can be set as the default for each account.

{: .notice} 
**PLease note:** If you create a new workdays object with an isDefault key set to true when there's already a special occasions object set as default for the account, LivePerson validation will set the new object created as the default. Refer to [Update workdays.](https://developers.liveperson.com/account-configuration-workdays-create.html)

### Assigning workdays/special occasions per skill

In order to assign a workdays item to a specific skill you should use the [Skills API](https://developers.liveperson.com/overview.html), and assign a **workingHoursId** or **specialOccasionId** field to the skill.

Refer to [Skills API - Appendix](https://developers.liveperson.com/administration-skills-appendix.html) for additional details.
