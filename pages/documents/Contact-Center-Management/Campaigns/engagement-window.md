## Engagement window studio basics

To provide a consistent experience across devices, you can design identical engagement windows for both desktop and mobile versions of the platform. Using the **Engagement window studio**, you can design a conversation window once and use it across any number of engagements.

### To access the Engagement window studio:

1. Open the **Engagement window library**

## Advanced window configuration and customization

In addition to the styling options within the window configuration, you can make the following advanced configurations:

* **Dialog button styling** - change the style of the primary and secondary dialog buttons in the engagement window to match your brand design guidelines
* **Window icons** - customize the top bar by choosing from a list of emojis. The 'Send' and 'End chat' are in the style of the window

![](/img/engagement-window-12.gif)

Available customizations:

* **Agent picture** - make the conversation more personal by configuring the agent’s picture to display in the engagement window
* **Rounded or square window corners** - control the exact radius of the window corners to produce a rounded or square effect

### Agent picture configuration

1. In the Conversational Cloud, go to the Users tab
2. Click on the row with the relevant agent’s name to edit their information
3. In the “Picture URL” field, add the URL of the agent’s personal picture

![](/img/engagement-window-9.png)

{:start="4"}

1. Click **Save**

{: .important}
**Note:** URL must be in “https” format, with recommended size of 200x200 pixels (up to 0.5MB), supported formats are PNG, JPG, and GIF

#### Defining agent picture appearance in the engagement window

Agent picture is defined individually per window. If you are using the same window in different engagements/campaigns, visitors will see the agent’s picture in both of them.

In order to define the agent’s picture in the selected engagement window, follow these steps:

1. Select the desired window from the Engagement window library
2. In the Engagement window studio select **Open additional window settings**

![](/img/engagement-window-10.png)

{:start="3"}

1. In the look and feel dropdown find the agent picture row
2. In the value column, select **Yes** from the dropdown menu in order to enable agent picture for the selected engagement window
3. Click **Save**

![](/img/engagement-window-11.png)

Now the visitor will see their agent’s picture next to each line sent by the agent in the chat engagement window.

{: .notice}
**Note:** In the case that the agent picture is enabled for a window but the agent did not configure their picture yet, the visitor will not see any picture while chatting with this specific agent.

#### Configuring a default picture

In order to define a default picture to be displayed when no agent picture is defined, follow these steps:

1. Select the desired window from the Engagement window library
2. In the Engagement window studio select **Open additional window settings**
3. In the Engagement window category, locate the Agent picture default URL row
4. In the Value column, add the URL of the default picture to be displayed for agents who did not configure their picture

{:start="5"}

1. Click “Save”

Visitors will now see the configured default picture beside each line sent by the agent with no configured personal picture.

#### Limitations

* **Join conversation:** If a second agent joins the conversation for whom a default picture URL is defined, the visitor sees the default picture next to second agent’s lines.
* **Because each window is configured separately, take into account the following:**
  In the case that different default pictures are defined in different engagement windows, when an agent transfers the conversation to an agent that has no assigned picture, the default picture displayed is the default picture defined for the conversation’s original engagement window. This is relevant to accounts using separate engagement windows for different departments.

### Rounded or square window corners

![](/img/engagement-window-13.gif)

Brands have the ability to set the radius of the top and bottom corners of the engagement window. The additional setting “Engagement window bottom corners” has been added to the “Additional window setting” section of the engagement window studio. The radius must be set in numbers, with or without px. Format example: 0px 0px 5px 5px. The limit will be 20px. An invalid format notification message will be displayed if the number is entered beyond the limit number.

By default the corner settings will be 0 0 0px 0px , which means that the corners are square, as today. This will apply to the embedded window, and the pop out, for both mobile and desktop.

**Enablement**
* Log into the Conversational Cloud
* Go to Engagement window studio
* Click on “Open additional window settings”
* Click on “Look and feel” section to expand
* Enter values for “Engagement window top corners” or “Engagement window bottom corners"
* Click on “Save”
