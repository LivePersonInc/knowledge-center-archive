The new Self Service Intent Discovery and Optimization features enable brands to tune their Intent taxonomy and deploy improved models within minutes.

The information architecture has been updated to ease navigation between LivePerson's Intent Analyzer and Intent Builder. 

Custom Starter Packs can be generated from historical chat transcripts as well as messaging transcripts. A minimum of 200K chat messages is required, but now brands who have recently migrated to messaging can utilize their chat history to automatically build out their own initial Intent taxonomy.

### Consumer Experience
