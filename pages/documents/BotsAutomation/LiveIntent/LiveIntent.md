### Technology around NLU and data science is opening the doors for brands to manage their contact centers more efficiently by better understanding consumer needs through intent.

Until today, brands were forced to hardcode consumer needs by categorizing them by choices they’ve made from a drop-down menu, and then matching their input to agent skills or pre-defined journeys. Yet, within agent skills there is a vast array of different inquiries, each with its own nuance. Even with the best reporting, analytics, and website trafficking across a brand’s web, IVR and apps, brands are still left guessing what their consumers want.

Conversational commerce, when brands enable consumers to ask questions, purchase products, and get help through their favorite messaging app or voice assistant, gives a far better opportunity for consumers to communicate their needs. With conversational commerce, the journey starts from the consumer’s intent and runs across the entire consumer journey. This allows brands to understand consumer behavior -- at scale -- in a way that’s not possible with website, IVR or apps. The text and utterances in these ongoing conversations are the most essential parts of understanding consumer intent.

## What is intent in a contact center?

Whenever a customer is initiating a conversation with a brand, whether it be with a bot or human agent, the customer comes with an intent and the ultimate goal of the customer is to fulfill this intent. A customer intent can be defined as a customers desire to change their state/ relationship with a brand.

The ability to accurately identify intent and provide the relevant service for the intent is at the forefront of building an efficient contact center. Through the combination of machine learning and human intelligence, LivePerson is building intent recognition and analysis tools to help brands identity and manage consumer needs. Using consumer intent as a driving force, brands can better track what is happening in a contact center and make fast progress in improving operations and automating customer interactions.

## Benefits of an intent-driven contact center

### Understand customer conversations

By implementing real time intent listening on all communication channels, brands gain unparalleled insight into their customer conversations that can be used to optimize operations throughout their contact centers.

### Take action on conversational events

Real-time inclusion of intent data into dashboards and reports enables brands to identify emerging trends and make quick operational adjustments where needed. Real time identification of intent enables brands to better orchestrate consumer conversations.

### Scale and optimize automation efforts

Automation and routing that is built on an understanding of customer intent is more efficient and enables smarter and more flexible experiences for customers. Tuning reports based on Intents enable brands to better prioritize automation investments

## Intent Manager in LivePerson

In a contact center driven by intent, brands are able to build, maintain, and manage intents. LivePerson’s Intent-Driven Contact Center allows brands to make consumer intent the foundation of contact center management and automation.

Brands are able to optimize their contact centers using consumer intent across a single “intent centric” management solutiom, consisting of a portal to build and manage intents and a set of agent manager and agent experiences that allow the intents to be used to improve the contact center.

Intents defined by the brand are visible in real-time and are available across all analytics products, enabling brands to understand the quality, goals/outcomes, and costs associated with individual intents.

## Benefits of being an Intent Centric Management Solution (ICMS)

* Drive automation strategy by exposing the costs, benefits, and risks of automation, intent by intent
* Improve the quality and efficiency of the agent experience by:

  - Routing the most effective agent for a given intent

  - Pinpointing effective handling strategies for training quickly

  - Creating new capabilities for incentivizing agent behavior across many intents
* Evaluate every change in the contact center in to make data-driven decisions by intent

## Use cases

## LivePerson Tools

LivePerson provides intent management out-of-the-box, which are intents that the platform comes with preconfigured to help you detect, monitor and manage conversations. LivePerson also developed new tools to enable brands to discover and analyze their own intents that have specific meaning to them. These intents can be seeds for new chatbots or to/hone in on a specific customer problem like a network outage that you want to continuously monitor. After all, intent is one of the most important touch points between customers, agents and bots.

## Where can you find intent management in LivePerson?

### Intent Manager
In the Conversational AI section, an Intent Manager button serves as the single point of entry for all Intent Manager components, including Intent Builder and Intent Analyzer.

The Intent Manager homepage is where users can view key coverage and quality stats, and access the four key elements of Intent Management in one unified navigation: Discover, Build, Analyze, Optimize. Navigation between Intent Manager sections (Discover, Build, Optimize, Analyze) is seamless and coherent. For brands that do not have Intent Analyzer enabled Analyze and Discovery features will be “locked”.

**Intent Builder** can be found under Intent Manager in the Conversational AI page, allowing brands to create your own intents and entities organized by domain.

**Intent Analyzer** can be found under Intent Manager in the Conversational AI page. Intent Analyzer integrates seamlessly with Intent Builder to provide a powerful unified system for intent modeling and management. When a brand subscribes to **LivePerson's Intent Analyzer**, it will also appear under the Intent Manager section of the Conversational AI tab, giving brands the ability to augment the capabilities of their LivePerson reports, tools, and services.

The next evolution of managing messaging programs within a contact center is through intent.
