Brands can deflect consumers who are eligible to message via WhatsApp from voice call to WhatsApp Business Messaging using IVR deflection. Proactive notifications from IVR systems allow brands to share an alert with the consumer on WhatsApp messenger, guiding them to continue the conversation over WhatsApp. Brands must send invitations as a WhatsApp Message Template.
