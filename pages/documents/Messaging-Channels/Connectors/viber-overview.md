Set up is easy and allows your agents to create ongoing connections with valuable customers right away; to onboard Viber to your account, please contact your LivePerson account team.

## Rich Functionalities

* **Image and File Sharing** — Image and File Sharing will empower consumers to share images with agents and vice versa to explain complex issues or requests quicker and more accurately. 

* **Welcome Message** — Brands can configure a welcome message that is shown to consumers once they follow a brand's viber account. The welcome message can contain a custom keyboard and will be shown as part of the conversation once the consumer sends a message.

* **Quick replies** — Quick replies are presented as custom keyboard on the Viber app and allow consumers to quickly select a predefined answer. 

* **Secure forms** — Secure forms allow brands to perform identification and authorization, safely share PII information to generate leads or to perform a registration process during a conversation in a PCI-compliant environment.

* **Auto messages** — Automatic messages are messages that are presented automatically in the Engagement Window during a conversation to provide contextual information to consumers about the status of the conversation.

* **Post Conversation Survey** — Gather feedback from consumers and measure their success across all messaging channels with the Post Conversation Survey.

## How conversations start
Consumers can start conversations after following a brand on viber and sending the first message.
