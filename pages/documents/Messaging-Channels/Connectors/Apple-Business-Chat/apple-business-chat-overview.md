Business Chat is supported by Apple devices running on iOS 11.3 and later or macOS 10.13.4 and later.

## Is Business Chat right for me? 

There are a few things you need to consider if you are thinking of adding Apple Business Chat to your messaging strategy. Business Chat is a great way to offer Rich Messaging, however it may not be for everyone. The channel is only available for your Apple customers. Check out the Operating System split of your customers’ devices -- do you have enough Apple users engaging your business to warrant Business Chat?  A number of independent studies suggest that users on Apple devices spend more than their counterparts on other platforms. Check your web and app analytics to determine share of Apple users, and revenue generated by this group. If you still want to proceed, then we recommend offering Business Chat to customers with Apple devices and other channels for Android users.
