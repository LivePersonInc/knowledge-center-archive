## Consumer side: sending a photo

Consumers can share photos from two sources:
1. Take a photo using the device’s camera and share it
2. Share a photo from their device’s Photo Library

Consumer can then add more information to the image by adding a caption. They can also see photos that they have shared in the messaging history on other devices.

Once a photo was uploaded, it will be flattened as to remove any potential malware from it.

## Agent side: receiving a photo

The agent has the following capabilities:
1. View a shared photo in the conversation as a thumbnail or full page.
2. View a shared photo in the Conversation History and also for closed conversations.

## Photo sharing flows (mobile-app)

### Initiation

From the conversation window, consumer clicks on the camera icon to open the Photo Sharing capability.

Two sharing options are presented to the consumer:
1. Take a photo using the device’s camera and share it
2. Share a photo from the Photo Library

### Device permissions

* When choosing to share a photo from the device’s camera, the SDK will ask for access permissions to the device’s camera.
* When choosing to share a photo from the Photo Library, the SDK will ask for access permissions to the device’s photos.

### Take photo

* Choosing “take photo” will open the device’s camera. The consumer can then take a photo and share it or retake it if needed.
* The consumer can add a caption to the photo before sharing it.
* When ready to share, the consumer can press on “send”.

### Photo library

Sharing a photo from the device storage will open the device’s Photo Library from which the consumer can choose a single photo and share it with the agent. The consumer can then send a picture with a caption as per the instructions above.

### Error and retry

In case sharing failed, an error indication in the conversation will call their attention to the failure. When clicking on the message, a retry option is set available for the consumer to press to resend the photo to the agent.
