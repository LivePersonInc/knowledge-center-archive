### Technology around NLU and data science is opening the doors for brands to manage their contact centers more efficiently by better understanding consumer needs through intent.

Until today, brands were forced to hardcode consumer needs by categorizing them by choices they’ve made from a drop-down menu, and then matching their input to agent skills or pre-defined journeys. Yet, within agent skills there is a vast array of different inquiries, each with its own nuance. Even with the best reporting, analytics, and website trafficking across a brand’s web, IVR and apps, brands are still left guessing what their consumers want.

Conversational commerce, when brands enable consumers to ask questions, purchase products, and get help through their favorite messaging app or voice assistant, gives a far better opportunity for consumers to communicate their needs. With conversational commerce, the journey starts from the consumer’s intent and runs across the entire consumer journey. This allows brands to understand consumer behavior -- at scale -- in a way that’s not possible with website, IVR or apps. The text and utterances in these ongoing conversations are the most essential parts of understanding consumer intent.

## What is intent in a contact center?

Whenever a customer is initiating a conversation with a brand, whether it be with a bot or human agent, the customer comes with an intent and the ultimate goal of the customer is to fulfill this intent. A customer intent can be defined as a customers desire to change their state/ relationship with a brand.

The ability to accurately identify intent and provide the relevant service for the intent is at the forefront of building an efficient contact center. Through the combination of machine learning and human intelligence, LivePerson is building intent recognition and analysis tools to help brands identity and manage consumer needs. Using consumer intent as a driving force, brands can better track what is happening in a contact center and make fast progress in improving operations and automating customer interactions.

## Benefits of an intent-driven contact center

### Understand customer conversations

By implementing real time intent listening on all communication channels, brands gain unparalleled insight into their customer conversations that can be used to optimize operations throughout their contact centers.

### Take action on conversational events

Real-time inclusion of intent data into dashboards and reports enables brands to identify emerging trends and make quick operational adjustments where needed. Real time identification of intent enables brands to better orchestrate consumer conversations.

### Scale and optimize automation efforts

Automation and routing that is built on an understanding of customer intent is more efficient and enables smarter and more flexible experiences for customers. Tuning reports based on Intents enable brands to better prioritize automation investments

## Intent management in LivePerson

In a contact center driven by intent, brands are able to build, maintain, and manage intents. LivePerson’s Intent-Driven Contact Center allows brands to make consumer intent the foundation of contact center management and automation.

Brands are able to optimize their contact centers using consumer intent across a single “intent centric” management solution (ICMS), consisting of a portal to build and manage intents and a set of agent manager and agent experiences that allow the intents to be used to improve the contact center.

Intents defined by the brand are visible in real-time and are available across all analytics products, enabling brands to understand the quality, goals/outcomes, and costs associated with individual intents.

## Benefits of being an Intent Centric Management Solution (ICMS)

* Drive automation strategy by exposing the costs, benefits, and risks of automation, intent by intent
* Improve the quality and efficiency of the agent experience by:

  \- Routing the most effective agent for a given intent

  \- Pinpointing effective handling strategies for training quickly

  \- Creating new capabilities for incentivizing agent behavior across many intents
* Evaluate every change in the contact center in to make data-driven decisions by intent

## Use cases

### Discover and define consumer intents

* Develop and refine brand ontology and taxonomy
* Train NLU models to detect and classify intents in customer conversations
* Monitor Intent Performance

### Optimize operations based on intents

* Evaluate agent performance
* Isolate consumer effort from consumer adoption (True FCR)
* Understand and optimize cost to serve by intent
* Identify and act on emergent intents
* Improve staffing forecasts

### Using intent to build the right automations

* Creating intent structures to properly handle customer queries
* Work with team that works directly with customers - get them actively involved
* Prioritize intents based on data - leverage transcripts

## LivePerson Tools

LivePerson provides intent management out-of-the-box, which are intents that the platform comes with preconfigured to help you detect, monitor and manage conversations. LivePerson also developed new tools to enable brands to investigate and discover their own intents that have specific meaning to them. These intents can be seeds for new chatbots or to/hone in on a specific customer problem like a network outage that you want to continuously monitor. After all, intent is one of the most important touch points between customers, agents and bots.

## LiveIntent Dashboard

LiveIntent dashboard enables Brands to automatically identify and take action on customer intent through every turn in a conversation.

We developed a deep-learning model that allows us to group messages by intent. Each point in the plot represents an utterance with an intent in it. What matters most in the grouping. Grouping of intents about understanding international channels and validating what we happen with international travel for the telephone bills. The model has learned to connect these intents by keywords.

All this clustering is done automatically, based on user transcripts and user to agent conversations - not experts involved in cleaning these intents and conversation in any way. However we can add human experts to sharpen the intent analyzer.

The combination of machine learning and human intelligence to better understand and track what is happening in your contact center and to make fast progress in automating customer interactions.

## Where can you find intent management in LivePerson?

**Intent Builder** can be found under Conversational AI, allowing brands to create your own intents and entities organized by domain.

**LiveIntent** integrates seamlessly with Intent Builder to provide a powerful unified system for intent modeling and management. When a brand subscribes to **LiveIntent**, it will also appear under the Conversational AI tab, giving brands the ability to augment the capabilities of their LivePerson reports, tools, and services.

LiveIntent powers enhanced reporting and analytics for your bots and automation. Brands can leverage the consistent flow of data from LiveIntent to power next generation analytics, orchestrate conversations with Maven, and build effective automations with Conversation Builder.

At LivePerson, we believe the most powerful customer contact center is delivered when a brand is able to successfully understand their customer's intent, and use this knowledge to continuously improve the consumer experience, operations and efficiency. The next evolution of managing messaging programs within a contact center is through intent.
