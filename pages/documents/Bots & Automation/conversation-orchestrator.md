## What is Conversation Orchestrator?

Conversational Commerce has unlocked new channels for consumers to interact with brands on their terms. Consumer demand for messaging presents a challenge for brands to effectively handle high-volumes of messaging conversations while simultaneously delivering personalized and effective service to every consumer.
LivePerson’s Conversation Orchestrator offers brands tools to enable efficient and personalized customer journeys at scale, while allowing brands control and transparency over how AI is used in their business.

Conversation Orchestrator, part of LivePerson’s Conversational AI, empowers brands to create highly personalized conversational experiences for their customers. Conversation Orchestrator provides the following key value to brands:
* **Humans in loop**: Accelerate human agents in the contact center with Next Actions
* **Go handsfree with AI**: Centralized AI policy experience that evolves with your business, and allows you to use all information to make decisions using the Conversation Context Service.
* **Connect to an AI ecosystem**: Use Next Actions APIs from an application or bot, or go faster with inbox predictions and models
* Drive continuous improvements using **Conversation Orchestrator learning**, that improves predictions and outcomes with more usage.

Conversation Orchestrator includes four capabilities that enable brands to achieve conversational commerce at scale:
