## Migrating plan
LivePerson has launched the enhanced Agent Workspace for messaging. We will be retiring the old workspace, after which the link to revert back to the old workspace will no longer be available.   

Many customers have already moved to the new workspace and are benefiting from its enhancements and new functionalities. We’ve updated the new workspace to the WCAG accessibility standards and this workspace simplifies agent operations and dramatically increases efficiency.

## FAQs about migrating customers to the enhanced Agent Workspace

### Q: Does the enhanced Agent Workspace have all the same features as the old workspace?
A: Yes. The enhanced agent workspace will include all features that are supported in the old workspace along with new functionalities.

### Q: What are the benefits of the enhanced workspace?
A: The enhanced workspace simplifies agent operations to dramatically increase agent focus and efficiency.

Specifically, the workspace has a new look and feel, a dynamic conversation list with built-in automation sorts conversations by the response time. It shows a full history of the conversation within the same window, enhanced customization of options and more. The enhanced agent workspace is also WCAG 2.1 AA certified.
