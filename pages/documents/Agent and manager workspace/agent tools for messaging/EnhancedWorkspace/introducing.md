Enhanced by automation and featuring an upgraded design, the Agent Workspace is fine-tuned to boost your efficiency as an agent and improve the productivity of messaging operations. The Workspace's design caters specifically to the unique demands of messaging, featuring self-serve capabilities and utilizing automatic algorithms on the backend to dynamically prioritize conversations for you. The dynamic list allows agents to work more intuitively, saving precious time and removing the need for guesswork.

## Main features of the Agent Workspace

**Fine-tuned UI:** The platform’s look and feel was designed to give agents maximum efficiency in messaging operations. With the conversation list prominently displayed and easy access to all your widgets, you will be able to handle more conversations concurrently with ease. 

**Next recommended conversation:** The dynamic conversation list features built-in automation that tells you which conversation to answer next, removing the need for decision making that can be time consuming and prone to human error. 

**Idle status filter**: The ‘idle’ status filter allows you to determine which conversations have been pending a consumer response for over five minutes.

**History in transcript:** The conversation history appears directly in the transcript so that you can easily access past conversations, rather than needing to navigate to a dedicated widget or look for a specific conversation. 

**Closed conversation status filter:** Closed conversations can be filtered into the conversation list by status, allowing agents to ensure that all their documentation is in place when wrapping up their shift. 

**Agent survey:** The agent survey allows brands to collect feedback from agents after their conversations are complete. This information can then be used to optimize messaging operations.
