## Overview

KnowledgeAI unifies and leverages your brand’s content to provide fast answers to common questions and issues, and effectively automate consumer conversations at scale. Using KnowledgeAI, brands can ingest and transform existing content into messaging-ready answers and seamlessly answer consumer questions in rich, automated conversations.
 
### Challenges:
**Automating answers at scale:**
* Content is often scattered across multiple sources
* Relevant, accurate answers are hard to pick out of content
* Answers are often too long or otherwise not yet ready for use with messaging
* Answers aren’t in the right form to use across channels


### Key features and capabilities:
**KnowledgeAI makes automating answers easy and self-serve**:
* Ingest content from a variety of sources, like CMSs, Google Sheets, and CSVs
* Transform content into messaging-ready answers to help consumers across channels: Web, SMS, Apple Business Chat, and more
* Use AI to answer the question the consumer asked in any language supported by our NLU or supported third-party NLU engines
* Automate AI-powered answers to consumer questions
* Equip agents with time-saving, AI-powered answers
* Improve results through analysis of historical answer performance and testing

## Benefits
### Unify knowledge from multiple sources
* Continue to use the tools and platforms that your brand’s content developers are familiar with. KnowledgeAI allows brands to simply:
  * Integrate a CMS or Google sheet
  * Import a CSV full of content
  * Work from scratch directly within KnowledgeAI
* Connect your brand’s content source to KnowledgeAI via an API to power messaging-ready answers, with little or no manual effort

* Use powerful analytics to measure and improve the impact of answers
* Track and improve efficiency of your answers and automations

### Automate answers 
Use the same content source to:
* Power Conversation Builder bots with answers, reaching your consumers across channels: SMS, Apple Business Chat, voice, and more
* Recommend answers to agents within Conversational Cloud’s agent workspace

### Equip agents with a toolbelt of easy-to-use responses
