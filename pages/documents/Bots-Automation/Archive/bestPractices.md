### Use Skill Filters to ensure the right customer issues are routed correctly

### Discover customer issues in real time

Use the [Time and Filter settings](ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-dashboard.html#filters) to track for negative MCS and CSAT intents in real-time.

HOW TO

### Use search to discover new intents

Intent Analyzer is designed to track the intents that you create in Intent Builder. However, through the use of the [Search](ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-dashboard.html#search) bar, you can use Intent Analyzer to discover intenful statements in conversations that you are not currently tracking.

HOW TO

When you've uncovered the intentful statements that seem meaningful

### Use Conversation Viewer to improve intent detection confidence

You may notice that some intents in Intent Analyzer have poor confidence scores. You can improve this by adding more/better training phrases in Intent Builder.

Intent Analyzer can help you determine good training phrases in the [Conversation Viewer](ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-dashboard.html#agent-conversations-and-transcripts).

### Improve customer experiences

The Intent Analyzer dashboard can show you not just the volume of intents, but also the [quality of conversations](ai-bots-automation-intent-analyzer-dashboard.html#intents-with-lowest-mcs) with intents.

Of course there can be many reasons why a conversation has low MCS. Perhaps the nature of the intent is negative, eg. "outage".

What Intent Analyzer can help you do is pin-point exactly where issues exist, however.

### Discover intents that are ripe for automation

If the average duration is low, high confidence intent, high volume intent, then it could be automated and time given back to human agents.

### Explore how bots are performing on particular intents

Filter to just bots. Maybe a specific dialog needs to improve.
