Maven is LivePerson’s continuously-learning AI engine that orchestrates all conversational interactions to ensure the best outcomes - the brain inside our conversational commerce platform.

Recommended Actions is Maven’s agent assistance feature that actively recommends or executes hand-offs to bots based on the conversation. It scans each conversation turn for intent, and then determines and presents the next best action to the agent. By incorporating automations mid-conversation, Recommended Actions frees up agent capacity to handle other messages, making agents significantly more efficient.

#### Key benefits of Recommended Actions

* Examines each conversational turn to assess consumer intent
* Recommends or executes the next action for the best outcome
* Makes human agents more efficient by enabling them to hand off menial tasks to automations
* Accelerates utilization of existing automations by improving contextual discovery

#### How it works

**Intent recognition:** Maven intercepts each message and leverages all the bots registered to assess their understanding of customer’s intent. Intent is understood by leveraging different NLU providers (1st party or 3rd party) built into each bot from their respective platforms: LivePerson’s Conversation Builder, Watson, or DialogFlow

**Actions recommended in real time:** Maven analyzes all available bots and automations to match the identified intent, and recommends the best automation in real time to the agent. Recommendations are done by choosing the highest ranked bot by score, after calibrating the score using a machine learning based on historical performance of the bot. Agents can then easily opt to manually transfer the conversation to the recommended automation.

![](/img/week-of-march-25th-1.png)

**Closed-loop training for optimization:** Agents are able to rate the relevance and usefulness of the recommended automation using a simple thumbs-up or down button. Maven then registers and utilizes the feedback to train the model for all future recommendations.

**Plug in any automation or bot:** Build automations or bots using LivePerson’s [Conversation Builder](https://developers.liveperson.com/conversation-builder-conversation-builder-overview.html), or integrate bots that were created using Dialogflow or Watson. See the tutorials and guides in the Conversation Builder to learn how to get started.

### \[Web messaging\] Welcome message with Quick Replies

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

The new welcome message feature allows brands to set the first message (after a consumer has opened the conversation window) with a list of quick replies of common intents to be addressed over messaging. The consumer’s quick reply selection will be considered the first message to open the conversation in the agent workspace, allowing the brand to configure the bot with a very specific and accurate logic/decision tree.

* The welcome message can be configured as either simple text, or with a simple text and quick replies.
* The brand can disable/enable the welcome message.
* Configuration is done at the engagement window level. So a brand can present different welcome messages with different quick reply options based on customer information and journey on the website (campaign and engagement settings).
* The consumer’s quick reply message selection will be inserted as a consumer message in the conversation
* It is possible to configure whether the welcome message will be presented only to first time consumers, or in every new conversation.
* Default settings (backward compatible):
  * LiveEngage default text message, without quick replies
  * Presented only to first time consumers

**Configuration:**

Under Engagement Window Studio => Add Elements

**Image 1: configuration location**

**Image 6: Consumer selected one of the Quick Replies options and conversation started**

![](/img/week-of-march-25th-7.png)

**Limitations:**

* Preview in the studio is not supported
* Up to 24 quick replies
* 8 quick replies will be presented per row - fixed value
* Up to 25 characters in each quick reply
* Styling is inherited from the Agent Bubble styling configuration
* Conversational metadata (external id) of the quick reply is not populated
* Once a conversation is closed by the consumer, the window remains open and therefore the welcome message will appear again (in case it was set to be presented for every new conversation).

Today, brands that are looking to authenticate their consumer via the Apple Business Chat authentication message must have a bot added to the LE conversation (via the Agent SDK). This causes a couple of complexities for brands:

* Brands that currently are not using a bot with their messaging operations will not be able to use this service unless they involve a new bot deployment, which raises a lot of difficulties for them: deployment pricing, operational changes etc.
* Brands that are using a bot will need to change their deployments to support the metadata response while integrating the reopens with the brand's backend system only in order to then display the authentication information in a customized agent widget. This causes unnecessary complexity, where it can all be integrated via the agent widget SDK only.

<br/>
**The solution:**

* The ABC Authentication Interactive response can include two different types of responses:
  * Successful: will include token string
  * Failure: will include the error code
* The Apple Business Chat authentication responses will be exposed to the agent widget SDK public model structure
* Brands will be able to expose the ABC successful authentication response via the widget SDK methods to their backend auth servers in order to validate the token against their services
* Brands will be able to fetch the user's authenticated information from their auth services after validating the token, while exposing the user auth data to the agent on LE through a customized agent widget
* Brands will be able to expose the ABC failed response via the agent widget SDK method to their auth services, while validating the error type and status
* Brands will be able to then present the auth error response to the agent on LE via an agent customized widget, while allowing the agent to help the consumer to sign in successfully or help identify where the issue in signing in is.

{: .notice}
**Note:** Brands will be able to leverage this feature only if they provide their own public key for the authentication. Otherwise, the widget window will not display the details.

### \[CM connector\] Outbound campaigns - CM integration

Today brands are using push notifications and SMS campaigns to their customers for the following use cases: increase in revenues, improve their service and retention. The new outbound campaigns integration allows brands the ability to connect CM to our conversational platform, benefiting from the following capabilities:

* Seamless messaging conversation
* Routing to skill
* Routing to bot
* Reporting

WhatsApp has added read indications for messages sent by agent to consumer. This capability is now supported for the WhatsApp Business connector.

* **Read indication** - will be shown to the agent once consumer has read his message - the read indication is presented as two orange checkmarks on the agent message in the LE UI conversation thread

**Please note:** This status is in addition to the already supported indicators (Sent, Delivered, and Failed to deliver).

### \[Web experiences\] Consumer step up authentication (CX-91)

<div class="tablecontainer">
<table class="releasenotes">
<thead>
<tr class="categoryrow">
<th>Web Messaging</th>
<th>Mobile App Messaging</th>

<th>Facebook Messenger</th>

</div>

Step up authentication is being released for **early adopters**. Today, when a registered consumer engages a brand in an unauthenticated conversation, then during conversation the consumer logs in and authenticates with the brand, the conversation will continue as unauthenticated. An unauthenticated conversation will not be linked to the previously authenticated conversation. Two different conversations exist for the same consumer. Potentially the new conversation may go to a different agent. The conversation continuity/context is lost on a new conversation since the agent is unable to see the unauthenticated conversation history.

This prevents brands to be unable to handle returning consumers effectively and unable to offer authenticated business functions such as account upgrades and account support. The Step up authentication feature allows brands to fully migrate to messaging for a richer consumer and agent experience.

Once a consumer authenticates, no new conversations will be created for the same consumer. Instead, unauthenticated consumer will be switched with authenticated consumer and the agent will be able to see unauthenticated conversation history maintaining the continuity of the conversation. Agent will also be able to see the consumer’s PII information reflected in the live conversation. The feature will support either consumer or agent initiating the step up from unauthenticated state to authenticated state during the conversation.

**Limitations**

* Step up is not supported in single page applications (SPA). When user authenticates the page has to be refreshed.
* The identity of the consumer must be passed using the identities array and identity function and not using SDEs.
* Step up is not supported in external window mode.

### \[Web experiences\] Added support for authorized consumer identity (CX-177)

When configuring authenticated web messaging, brands must send the consumer’s ID through JavaScript on the web page. The consumer’s ID might be considered as sensitive data. The problem with this is that this data is sent as plain text.

**Fix:** Instead of providing the consumer ID, the brand will provide the encrypted JWT through JavaScript on the web page.

The brand will provide the encrypted JWT (aka - JWE) in a new attribute of consumer “identity” json:

    lpTag.identities.push(identityFn);
      function identityFn(callback) {
        callback({
          iss: “replace with issuer”,
          acr: “loa1”,
          tkn: “replace with encrypted jwt (jwe)”
      });
    }

<br/>
**Limitation:** This enhancement is currently supported only for authentication flow type “oAuth 2.0 authentication (code)”. Flow type “oAuth 2.0 authentication (implicit)” will be supported in future releases.

### \[Messaging history API\] Consumer Step-Up Authentication (LE-98860)

Expanding Messaging Interaction API for consuming CustomerStepupEvent and modifications in ParticipantAddEvent. With step-up authentication, the consumer can start the conversation with an unauthenticated flow and move to an authenticated flow. For more technical information please refer to our [documentation](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-interactions-api-methods-conversations.html#response) in the Developers Community.

### \[Messaging history API\] Post Conversation Survey search (AE-641)

Enable brands to gain new insight from conversations in which the Post Conversation Survey was configured by adding a new filtering capability to the All Connections tab in LiveEngage.

This new capability will allow brands to filter out and view specific conversations based on their survey outcomes, words matched in transcripts, and CSAT, NPS, and FCR answers.

When an account enables "User Profile" to allow the consumer’s name to be displayed in the agent conversation window, and then disables it, the last name doesn't clear from previously enabled state.

**Fix:** If an account has "User Profile" disabled after enabling it, the name in the open connections list, the consumer info widget view in the agent workspace, as well as at the top of the agent's messaging conversation window should be set to blank.

In web messaging, when a consumer minimizes the window and the agent sends a message, once the consumer maximizes the window again, it does not scroll down to the bottom of the conversation.

**Fix:** Brands have the option to set whether they want the window when maximized to scroll down to the bottom of the conversation automatically or stay on the last position of the conversation in case the agent sends messages while the window is minimized.

**Note:** This feature requires enablement. Please contact your LivePerson representative for more information.

On accounts with “Show history for closed messaging conversations ” flag in LE-UI is “NO, a consumer starts an unauthenticated conversation from an iphone/ipad using Chrome/Safari, while messaging with the agent, and then exits the messaging window, but the agent closes out the conversation or the conversation is closed out by auto-closed. When the consumer goes back to the browser and continues the conversation by typing a new message, the messages are not sent displaying the red error indication. The consumer is unable to close the window unless the page is reloaded.

**Fix**: If a conversation was closed for any reason while the consumer is disconnected, any new messages will be treated as a new conversation.

### \[Web experiences\] Web messaging structured content card sent twice via routing bot (CX-162)

When a consumer starts a conversation in a web messaging window, and the routing bot replies with a structured content card with a specific action that redirects to a URL, the URL gets redirected when the consumer clicks on the action and the routing bot shows the next card configured on the link button twice. Both the consumer and agent receive the message twice.

**Fix**: Added wait time between each action to ensure that it arrives to the agent only once for each click.
