## Limit the maximum number of open bot convs to 999 
### Type: Bug fix (Third Party Bot Connectors Version 2.24.9 Worker 2.24.5 API)

With this Hotfix, LivePerson will now limit the number of open conversations per one bot to 999 max. 
Any new conversation arriving after hitting the limit will be error escalated with a new error type, as described in the [Developers Center.](https://developers.liveperson.com/third-party-bots-bot-conversation-errors.html#comlivepersonbot-connectors-workererrorpipesconversation-limit-checkermax-conv-limit-reached)

## Close/transfer conversations on bot stop not working properly 
### Type: Bug fix (Third Party Bot Connectors Version 2.24.9 Worker 2.24.5 API)

Currently, if a bot is stopped, the customer has an option to close or transfer all currently connected conversations. However, if one of these conversations fails to close/transfer, the action is aborted. With this fix we will ensure to perform the desired actions on all connected conversations, even if something fails in the meantime.

## [Messaging Window] Configuration to collapse message history when loading new conversation
### Type: Enhancement (Web experiences 10.6)

As part of an effort to improve load times for a new conversation, we have added the ability to hide older messages behind a button. The two most recent conversations will show in the window and each conversation can be displayed by pressing the “Show Previous” button. If the consumer does not have more than two previous conversations, the button will not show. This feature allows for faster loading of the message window while still having older conversations available to the consumer. Transcripts will function as they always have, printing the entire text conversation. 

**Customization:** Brands are able to customize the look and feel of the “Show Previous” button based on the following CSS properties within the Window Customization API:

## [Messaging Window] WCAG 2.1 AA / Accessibility Remediation
### Type: Enhancement (Web experiences 10.6)

The Web Experiences team is partnering with a website accessibility firm to remediate, validate, and ultimately certify the LivePerson consumer experience as WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.  To reach WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, we will be deploying fixes to the consumer experience over the next few months that will incrementally get us to certification.  

Please note that issues that are remediated and validated under WCAG 2.1 AA compliance only apply for the default engagements, window themes, and out-of-the-box features/taglets within the consumer window. Any Brands that utilize custom windows, taglets, and engagements, should be reviewed and updated by the customer, or their representative, to meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
