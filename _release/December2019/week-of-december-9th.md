## Agent status not updated correctly in case of backend failure

Whenever agent changes their status within LiveEngage, sometimes the new status chosen by the agent was only updated in the LiveEngage UI and this change was not reflected in the backend (due to connectivity issues).
This caused a discrepancy between the status displayed to the agent and the actual status reported to the backend server. It may also have affected the reporting.

This bug has been fixed, and now whenever there are connectivity issues/backend issues, LiveEngage UI will be updated with the new agent status (according to the actual status saved in the server).

## Reject conversations when agent not online

Whenever an agent changes status on LiveEngage from Online to Away/Back soon, LiveEngage UI displayed the newly updated status to the agent, without validating that all of the backend systems are aware of the status change.

For this reason, messaging accounts could experience a discrepancy between the status displayed to the user on LiveEngage (e.g - Agent displayed as Away), while in realtime, the agent kept getting incoming messaging conversations (since the internal backend server considered the agent to be Online).

This bug has been fixed, and now whenever the agent changes status through LiveEngage to Away/Back soon, any incoming Messaging conversation will be rejected.

A fix was made on the new agent workspace for memory leak with Custom Widgets working with Internet Explorer 11. It caused the LiveEngage old workspace to crash whenever the user clicked “Hide conversation”.

For customers using custom widgets, and reporting engagement attributes, it was found that the following engagement attributes structure were different in old workspace vs. the new workspace.
The following field names have been changed:

This bug has been fixed, and the field names are now identical to the old workspace names.

Report Builder dashboards were enhanced to include the Agent login name and the agent email address in addition to the agent name. The change applies to all dashboards that include the Agent attributes.

In order to use the new fields (agent login name, email address) you will have to select the existing agent column, click on 'Display Attribute Name' and choose the columns.
You can add the login name and email name as additional columns to the grid, or you can replace the current agent name with one of the two columns added.
