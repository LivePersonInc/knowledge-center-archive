The FaaS Debugger allows the user to start a new debugging session for any function. This provides developers with the capability to identify semantic issues during development faster.
As of now, the Debugger allows you to manage breakpoint, start/stop debugging session, step-over to next line, continue to new breakpoint/end, check variable values & show log output. Step-into functions is currently not supported.

Please note that each FaaS user-session will have an exclusive sandbox for debugging, while starting the debugger for the first time, users of the FaaS Debugger might experience a longer start up period (max. 30 sec).

So far FaaS ensured that your function is always running, even if it has not been invoked for the past weeks. In order to save server capacity we introduced the scale to zero feature for FaaS, Functions that have not been invoked for the past 72 hours, will be automatically stopped and warmed up on-demand during first invocation. This currently comes with a cost of 8 sec. warm-up time. In case this warm-up time is currently not acceptable, a scheduled job can be maintained to trigger an invocation within 72 hours. Please note that scheduled invocations are triggered without any input-data.

**Note:** Warm-up time will be reduced in future to be around 1 - 1.5 sec and Sleep-Mode will start after a few minutes.
