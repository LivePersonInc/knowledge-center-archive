The timing and scope of these features or functionalities remain at the sole discretion of LivePerson and are subject to change.

## Rich content consumer events are forwarded to the bots 

### Type: New feature [Bot Connectors 2.37]

**Available to all customers?** Yes

Rich content events will now be processed by Third-Party Bots and the data will be made available to all bots through the context data. 
Exactly which events are supported depends on the channel, e.g., on WhatsApp the consumer can now share its location with the bot.
Rich content messages can be identified by the com.liveperson.bot-connectors.consumer.send-rich-content identifier in the message payload.
The data of such a message can be found inside the lpEvent sent on the context payload. 


## Support Conversational Cloud vanity domains

### Type: New feature [Bot Connectors 2.37]

**Available to all customers?** No

So far the Third-Party bots UI could only be fully accessed inside the Conversational Cloud if it was running under a LivePerson Domain. In order to support vanity domains this limitation has been removed. Be advised that the Third-Party Bots API will stay reachable only from LivePerson Domains and vanity domains.

## Support new version of the Medallia adapter

### Type: Enhancement [Bot Connectors 2.37]

**Available to all customers?** Yes
The Medallia adapter is able to send survey data asynchronously via the public API and disables all of Third-Party Bots static system messages on surveys except in case of internal errors. It also improves the information provided on survey conversation errors inside the bot dashboard.

## Dedicated wizard step for survey bots 

### Type: Enhancement [Bot Connectors 2.37]

**Available to all customers?** Yes

All survey bot settings not related to the AI vendor (the Medallia Adapter) have been moved to a separate step.
In this step the bot manager can configure which survey App ID and last conversation skill the bot accepts post conversation dialogues.
Additionally, the consumer-facing error message is now configurable in order to support addtional user cases, e.g. non-English surveys.

## Prevent already assigned agents from being reused

### Type: Fix [Bot Connectors 2.37]

**Available to all customers?** Yes

The list of available agents in the wizard has been showing already assigned agents since the last release. This is fixed now and an additional check was added to the API to prevent bots from being assigned if they are already in use even in case the API is accessed directly.

## No override of authenticated SDEs with ‘null’ values

### Type: Fix [Bot Connectors 2.37]

**Available to all customers?** Yes

The consumer profile data can contain multiple SDEs of the same type. When merging these entries Third-Party Bots has accepted ‘null’ values as valid data in the past. With this fix ‘null’ values will no longer override properties of another SDE entry of the same type.
