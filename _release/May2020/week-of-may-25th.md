## Developers Center Redesign
### Enhancement

The LivePerson Developers site will receive a new look & feel enabling a better experience for new and existing users to find content more intuitively.

To access the site please go to https://developers.liveperson.com/.

The Welcome page contains content that helps you learn about the key products and services offered by LivePerson.

The Getting Started page takes you through the first steps of creating and setting up an account and helps you get familiar with LivePerson API’s so you can build & customize your own solutions.

The search experience provides a contextual “preview”. This displays the sentences that contain the keyword being searched and allows you to have more information before making a selection. 

LivePerson will continue to enhance the Developers Center to ensure the best user experience for our developers.

## Greeting for accepted transferred messaging conversations 
### Type: New feature (Bot Connectors 2.18)
The Bot Connector system is designed to respond to incoming messaging by the consumer, once the bot is engaged in the conversation. Enabling the Welcome Messages settings, allows Brands to compose an initial message that the bot can send out that is not in direct response to the consumers messages. This allows for the bot to connect to a conversation and send out an initial message without waiting for the consumer to send a message after the bot first joins the conversation.

## Private Messages 
### Type: New feature (Bot Connectors 2.18)
This feature will enable customers to leverage the UMS Private Text feature thus allowing customers to send Private Text messages via all supported AI vendors in third-party bots. Private text messages are only visible to the agent and manager in Agent Workspace and end users will not be able to see those messages.
