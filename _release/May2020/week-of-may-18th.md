{: .notice}
Before using this feature, it must be enabled in Conversation Builder by LivePerson. Contact your LivePerson account representative to have this configuration change made.

In this release, Conversation Builder introduces survey bots, which you can create and manage directly within the Conversation Builder application. A survey bot lets you collect feedback from consumers at the end of a conversation with a custom bot or human agent. The survey bot can ask:
- Specialized questions designed to provide First Call Resolution (FCR), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey metrics
- Questions that reflect your brand's key performance indicators
- e-text questions

Use a survey bot to measure bot/agent and skill performance and to identify opportunities to improve on your quality targets.

Please note:
- To use survey bots created in Conversation Builder, you must log into Conversation Builder via single sign-on through the Conversational Cloud (previously known as LiveEngage). This feature isn't supported on the AWS platform where you log into Conversation Builder directly.
- Survey bots are supported only in Messaging, not in Live Chat.
- Before using this feature, it must be enabled in Conversation Builder by LivePerson. Please contact your LivePerson account representative to have this configuration change made.

In this release, we’ve enhanced the language support for simple and complex bots:

#### Simple bots
These are bots that don’t use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for intent matching and instead rely on pattern matching. When you create a simple bot and set the bot’s language, you can now specify any language that’s desired. The list of available languages includes all those supported by available NLU providers (LivePerson, Google Dialogflow, and IBM Watson). If you don’t see the language that you need, you can select “Other” and specify the language.

#### Complex bots: 
These are bots that use some measure of NLU for intent matching. When you create a domain, you can now select from all languages supported by the NLU provider (LivePerson, Google Dialogflow, and IBM Watson). Previously, only a subset of the 3rd-party NLU provider’s languages were available.

{: .notice}
When you create a complex bot and set the bot’s language, take care to select the language of the domain that will be associated with the bot. Otherwise, errors will occur during NLU processing.

Proactive Messaging enables brands to send outbound messages to consumers and when consumers respond creating 2-way conversations in Conversation Cloud platform (previously named LiveEngage). Proactive Messaging v2.0 API is the latest API release with a high send rate (up to 10 messages/account/second), rate limiting, support for guardrails and integrates with LE campaign and engagement for conversation routing. Proactive Messaging v2.0 API is currently available to all customers for WhatApp channel.

Provide LivePerson Proactive team with the user key and secret of the 2 bots created in step #2. We will coordinate this with you after you fill out the details in step 1. 
LivePerson will provide brands the client ID and secrets which will be used to create an app jwt for authentication.

FaaS CLI is LivePerson Functions’ very own command line interface. It allows you to create, deploy and manage Functions as well as debug them without the need to login into the FaaS UI. If you work with FaaS on a daily basis you can expect many quality of life improvements such as being able to use your own development tools (e.g. visual studio), easily share code across different accounts or managing the versioning of your function using popular tools such as git.
