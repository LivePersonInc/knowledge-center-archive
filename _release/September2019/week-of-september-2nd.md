  * Supported document types: PDF, DOC (X), PPT (X), XLS(X)
  * The default notification message for this is: “Sorry! Unfortunately we are unable to send this file type”
* **File size limit** - consumer will get this message when trying to share files or images that exceed the file size limit
  * Supported image size: up to 10 MB
  * Suported document size: up to 15 MB
  * The default notification message for this is: “Sorry! Unfortunately we are unable to send this file due to file size limit”
* **Unsupported message type** - consumer will get this message when trying to send any other message types that are supported by Line but not by LiveEngage (i.e: sharing location or when file sharing is off)
  * The default notification message for this is: “Sorry! Unfortunately we are unable to send this type of message”

The Line connector has been enhanced to support the Post Conversation Survey (PCS). The Post Conversation Survey enables brands to gather feedback from consumers and measure their success. Once a messaging conversation is ended by the agent, the survey will be automatically triggered. The bot will start to send the questions one by one as configured by the brand. Upon each consumer response, the bot will send the next question based on the logic defined. The survey questions and answers are based on regular text messages - all customized by the brand.

The survey can be closed in a number of different scenarios: Survey completed, survey timeout or survey skipped. Each outcome is tracked and reported on as part of the Report Builder to allow brands to fully analyze the results.

For more details on PCS and how it is configured, please [read here](/ai-bots-automation-post-conversation-survey-bot.html).

When a consumer blocks or deletes an official brand, the brands can no longer send messages to this consumer. Therefore, the Line connector will automatically close an open conversation with this consumer, if it exists, to prevent agents from sending messages to the consumer.  In case an agent attempts to send a message to the consumer by resuming the conversation, he will see an error message in the agent workspace.

Bot Connectors now support “Custom Integration.” This allows the customer to write a custom vendor connector or bot implementation using LivePerson’s Functions (FaaS). The response to the customer can be customized using FaaS. This is acheived by the bot sending all messages and events it receives to the FaaS services, where they can be manipulated and then sent back to the customer.

**Dependencies:** LivePerson FaaS including customized events and templates

## [Bot Connectors] Finish initialization of job before the execution of bot

### Type: Bug fix

If the bot is started via the UI, but is in the start mode and then gets closed/shutdown, the clean up job is performed asynchronously, thus making job processing continue with the login/initialization tasks and executes the bot. However, as the job was deleted and yet not finished, it will be executed and become an orphan. Because of this it can only be removed by deleting the executing pod. This should be avoided at all costs by first finishing up the initialization process before deleting the job.
