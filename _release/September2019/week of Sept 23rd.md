### Viewing photos sent by consumer

The LE mobile app now supports viewing photos sent by the consumer.  
When consumer sends a photo, it will be presented in the transcript in thumbnail view.  
Tapping on the image will open it in full view mode

### Sending photo to consumer

Users can now send photos from the LiveEngage mobile app to the consumers. If the conversation source (Connector) supports receiving photos from agent an “camera” button will be available in the input area bar. User can share photos from the device photo library or take photos using the device camera.

{: .notice}  
In this version, agent photo sharing is not supported for Apple Business Chat.

### Push notification enhancements

Up until now, there was a limitation that for a period of one minute after the app moves to the background, push notifications were not sent. In the new version, the push notification will start working as soon as the app is moved to the background.

### Session expired indication

If for some reason the LiveEngage mobile app session expired (e.g. the same user login to the LiveEngage web) an indication will presented in the app and the app will be logged out

## If conversation didn’t start, minimize should close the window

Today, when the consumer opens the engagement window and minimizes it without starting a conversation, the window is presented as minimized and at the same time the engagement invitation is presented. With this new enhancement, the window will close automatically when the consumer opens the window in web messaging and minimizes it before he starts the conversation. As a result, only the engagement invitation will be displayed. For chat, the behavior will stay the same.

## Close window automatically once consumer requests to clear history

Today, for unauthenticated web messaging, brands can provide consumers with the ability to clear the conversation history from the window. This option is available to the consumer as part of the window menu actions.

Currently, once a consumer selects “Clear history” option, he gets the following notification: _“Are you sure you want to clear your conversation history? If you choose "Yes" the conversation will end and your conversation history will no longer be available from this device”_

Once the consumer chooses “Yes”, the conversation ends but the window remains open and the history remains. It’s only after the consumer closes the window and opens it again that the history is cleared.

With this new version, once the consumer chooses “Yes”, the window will be closed automatically (regardless of the close window upon end of the conversation setting) and the notification text will be changed to: _"Are you sure you want to clear your conversation history? If you choose "Yes" the conversation will be closed automatically and your history will no longer be available when you reopen the window."_

## Remove “info” prefix from welcome message

When an engagement window is configured with a welcome message, the welcome message prefixes with the word “info” when displaying in the engagement window. With this change, the word “info” will be removed and only the welcome message will be displayed.

## "Show history for closed conversations" creates a fictitious load on the msghist service and console errors

### Type: Bug fix

</div>

When the "Show history for closed conversations" setting in campaigns is set to "Yes", this request will return the history. However, when it’s set to “No”, it returns a 401 error showing in the console. The engagement window will not make a call to the history API if the “Show history for closed conversations” setting is set to “No”. An error will not be seen in the console.

## \[Web messaging\] Difficulties loading conversation history

When a consumer opens an engagement window with a previous conversation and scrolls up to view the conversation history, the conversation history is not loading, showing the error “Failed to load history. Retry.” When clicking on retry, it doesn’t retry to load the same conversation history but instead skips it and tries to load the next one. This has been resolved.

## Survey does not continue after token refresh in unauthenticated web messaging

The survey stops once consumer replies to one of the questions after the token has expired in unauthenticated web messaging. This has been resolved.

## Allow country code domains that can not be SLDs

### Type: Bug fix

<div class="tablecontainer">
<table class="releasenotes">

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Countries that are marked as "NO" in the "SLD" column should be treated as part of the parent domain and the suffix. For example, UK is marked as YES, so for site.uk.com, "uk.com" is actually the suffix and the not parent domain. For BT which is marked as NO - site.bt.com, bt is actually the parent domain and not part of the suffix.

## Safari and IE11 cause customer view to shift (scroll bar move) when history API requests finish upon window load

### Type: Bug fix

<div class="tablecontainer">
<table class="releasenotes">
<thead>
<tr class="categoryrow">
<th>Web Messaging</th>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

When a consumer opens a new authenticated conversation, the window completes a Messaging Interactions API request to retrieve the consumer's recent history. When the Messaging Interactions API request completes, the window adds the new history to the top of the unified window. In IE11 and Safari, this causes the scroll bar to "jump" up to about half the height of the window, instead of maintaining the window scroll at the bottom of the window. This has been resolved.\\

**Fix:**
