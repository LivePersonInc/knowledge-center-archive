## [WhatsApp] Location sharing - Convert latitude and longitude params to Google Maps link

Currently when a WhatsApp consumer shares a location while in a conversation with a brand, the agent will receive the latitude and longitude parameters within the conversation thread (as text fields). In order to actually review the location (address) sent by the consumer, the agent needs to place the coordinates within a map service, which is an additional long and unnecessary step.

With the new location sharing enhancement, when a consumer shares his address/location with the agent, the agent will receive a structured content Map element to allow agents to quickly view the location shared by the consumer with a click. The new map element will contains a text with instructions, a clickable map image that when clicked by an agent will open up Google Maps to the shared location, and the location name and address info.

{: .notice}
**Please note:** When sharing the current location on WA, only a clickable map will be available, but the address and name of the location will not be mentioned in text.

Today, brands have the ability to set the radius of the top corners of the engagement window. This feature will allow brands the ability to also set the radius of the bottom corners of the engagement window.

The additional setting “Engagement window bottom corners” will be added to the “Additional window setting” section of the engagement window studio. The radius must be set in numbers, with or without px. Format example: 0px 0px 5px 5px. The limit will be 20px. An invalid format notification message will be displayed if the number is entered beyond the limit number.

By default the bottom corners settings will be 0 0 0px 0px , which means that the corners are square, as today. This will apply to the embedded window, and the pop out, for both mobile and desktop. The current setting for the top corners will be renamed from “Engagement window corners” to “Engagement window top corners”.

**Enablement**
* Log into LiveEngage
* Go to Engagement window studio
* Click on “Open additional window settings”
* Click on “Look and feel” section to expand
* Enter values for “Engagement window bottom corners”

This feature allows brands the ability to set the consumer actions menu location and elements within the web messaging window.

There are 2 options to set the location of the menu:
* At the bottom left side of the window (current location and default for Ocean and Horizon themes)
* Top right of the window, instead of the X icon

This configuration will be added to the “Add Elements” menu of the engagement window studio with the following changes:
* The text link is changed from “Menu elements” to “Menu position and elements”
* Under the “Menu elements” section the title is changed to “Menu position and elements”
* New radio buttons are added to provide the user the ability to select from one of the 2 positions options mentioned above.

In case a brand selects the top option, and the share file feature is enabled for the account, the attachment option will be moved from the menu element list to the consumer text area, and will be displayed as an attachment icon. In case brands want to remove the attachment option for the window (although enabled at the account level), brands can do so by clicking on the text area and disabling the attachment icon from the text area.

Once the top menu option is selected, the menu icon will replace the X icon (close/end icon). If the consumer would like to end the conversation, they can do so by choosing the end conversation option from the menu.

**Enablement**
* Log into LiveEngage
* Go to Engagement window studio
* Click on “Add elements” icon
* Click on “Menu position and elements”
* Under “Menu position and elements” section, select the position of the window
* Click Save

**Limitations**
* The top menu position is available for web messaging only and will not be visible in the engagement studio if the window is set for chat.

This feature defines a set of configurations that would enable brands to achieve finer control over what kind of scenarios would trigger the auto-close mechanism to reset its countdown to conversation close per a specific conversation. The new configuration will enable the control if a conversation auto-close timer should be reset or not when a conversation:

* Was opened for viewing without having the viewing agent join the conversation (joins just as a READER).
* Was joined by an agent/agent manager/admin as an active participant in the conversation.

Besides these new configurations, writing a line in the conversation or changing its state would still reset the auto-close timer.

## Restore AAM Query OrderBy
### Type: Bug Fix

The ExConversationChangeNotification response returns only 1000 conversations. This is expected behavior, but the conversations returned were not the most recent conversations, which led some clients to conclude that conversations they recently worked on were missing.

As a part of troubleshooting an “OrderBy” clause was removed from the buildQuery method of the N1QLBuilder class. This clause ordered the 1000 conversation results by recency, to return the most recent conversations to the client. The OrderBy clause was removed because it was believed to be redundant, and potentially causing a major issue. This was not the case, and in order to fix the returned conversations, the clause was re-added to the query.

## AgentGroup filter from LE UI for Agent + AgentManager

### Type: Bug Fix

If a user is marked as both an AGENT and AGENT_MANAGER, the agent group filtering feature did not properly apply a group filter to show a limited result conversations. Instead, all conversations were shown as if there was no filter applied.

The ordering of clauses on the filter query was fixed, resolving this filtering bug.

## Skill filter should be applied only when group filter is applied for a brand+user

### Type: Bug Fix

Two new features were recently added to UMS: Agent Group Filtering and Agent Skill Filtering. Agent Skill Filtering should be seen as a sub-feature of Agent Group Filtering, as it makes no sense outside of the context of Agent Group Filtering.

However, the initial implementation of the two filters technically allowed them to operate independently of each other, even though this is not a valid use case. To fix this, the implementation was changed to make the Agent Skill Filtering only possible to enable for a brand when Agent Group Filtering is enabled as well.

A change was made to the Agent Group Filtering to consider AGENT_MANAGER users without agents to manage as ‘super users’ that show all conversations in the brand.

A change was made to the Agent Group Filtering to allow users who are labeled as AGENT and AGENT_MANAGER to receive conversations filtered for the AGENT group assigned to them.

A change was made to the Agent Skill Filtering to allow users who are labeled as AGENT and AGENT_MANAGER to be notified for conversations on skills assigned to them, even if those skills are not shared by any other group or user.

## Allow LPA user to subscribe to groups

### Type: Bug Fix

LPA users were not present in Account Configuration (AC). Agent group filters which depend on data from AC thus did not apply to LPA users in the LiveEngage (LE) UI. This was resolved by adding LPA users to AC, allowing them to subscribe to groups and filter conversations in the LE UI.

## Ac users are deleted when delta arrived on callback

### Type: Bug Fix

When receiving a missing response from AC on delta calls we cleared the skills on the users, which led to an edge case of conversations that had no available agents by mistake and were routed to skill -1.

This enhancement adds the following elements to the authenticated PersonalInfo SDE contact list structure:
Country
Region
Zip Code

While country, region, and zip code have historically been a part of this SDE, the support was not available in the back-end chat system to make the fields available for consumption.  This ticket makes those data elements available to the agent via the LiveEngage UI as well as to applications that use this data either via Kafka or Hadoop.

One important note about this feature is that it required an update to the PersonalInfoEvent AVRO data model transformer (the software that converts SDEs from an internal Denver format to the standard AVRO format.  The previous version of that transformer is not forward compatible with the new elements, which means that parsing of the contact list with the new elements with systems using the old transformer will fail to parse the entire contact list structure, including existing fields such as email address and phone number, and these fields will show blank in any application that reads the event from kafka or hadoop.  It’s important to note that, while the data is not visible in applications using the old transformer, the data is still present and will become visible when the AVRO data model version is updated.  LiveEngage is not impacted by this.

Since this feature requires coordination with consuming applications, it is turned off by default behind a feature flag.
