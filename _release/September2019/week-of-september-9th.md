Managers will also be able to actively supervise key metrics like:

* Queue length
* CSAT levels
* Agent utilization and efficiency

Once an administrator clicks on a product tile, the product itself opens in a new browser tab. The goal of the Launchpad is to support easy product access, visibility and discoverability of the extensive capabilities that administrators have in the LivePerson ecosystem.

**Limitations**

* In this version, admins will see all services without differentiation of services that are/aren't enabled on the account.

Messaging load distribution is a routing capability that allows brands to define how would the messaging load gets distributed between different agent groups. This kind of capability is a necessity for brands that outsource their messaging operations and must meet clear contractual obligations as to which vendor handles which percentage of the total brand messaging traffic. It allows the brand to define that a specific agent group is correlated with a specific vendor and define, per skill, the way that the load will be distributed between the agent groups.

This feature is available to all customers. It is already available for Chat and now also available for Messaging)

**How to enable**

Contact your LivePerson account manager to enable

Configuring a load balancing per a specific skill is then made available through the Skills settings screen in LiveEngage. The account must have at least 2 agent groups in order for the feature to become visible in the UI.

**Dependencies**

* AC-users 5.3
* UMS 3.22
* LE-UI 10.12

{: .notice}  
This feature cannot be defined to work for both Messaging and Chat load balancing per a single skill.

**Limitations**
* When an agent resumes a conversation, it will be handled by that agent. However, if the agent transfers the conversation it could be transferred to a group that is different from the resuming agent’s group. There is a planned fix for this in the next release (UMS 3.23).
* The report for load balancing in the Report Builder currently has a bug calculating the total number of closed conversations per group, the data  is not showing as expected. For a workaround, please contact Itamar Chazanovitz. There is a planned fix for this in the next Report Builder release (October 19th).

mTLS is a more secure TLS connection, allowing services to use mutual authentication (Back and Forth). The mTLS gateway is our way to provide a more secure connection, aligned to industry standards while keeping the existing stability and responsiveness we are used to.

The mTLS Gateway is also a service for managing certificate over supported LiveEngage Apps (WebHooks and IDP for now, with more to come). Using this Self-Serve API is allowing our customers to use this service easily, including uploading, Updating and deleting the certificate, Create the mapping per URL and more. Integrating the mTLS Gateway to the existing WebHooks notifications, allowing us to send WebHooks notifications from LiveEngage.

**Which services and features are currently supported over mTLS?**
Currently, 2 features are supported by mTLS:
* WebHooks
* Consumer Authentication (OAuth2.0 Code Flow)

After developing and exposing the new mTLS service, we can now proceed with our plans to make the mTLS service accessible, by providing a new dedicated Self-Service UI for mTLS management, including creating and downloading the CSR, uploading the certificate and mapping of URLs.
