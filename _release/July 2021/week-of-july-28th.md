## Reply feedback now sent out when the agent selects the smart suggest option
### Type: Fix [Smart Suggestions]
  
Channels: All except for Chat

Available to all customers? No, only for accounts with the Smart Suggestions feature

Smart Suggestions used to call the Feedback API only when the agent actually sent the smart suggestion and not when the agent selected the suggestion. This has been updated and feedback is now sent once the agent selects the Smart Suggestion. 


## All Connections for Agents fails to Load 
### Type: Fix [Enhanced Agent Workspace]

Channels: All except for Chat

Replication Agent Workspace error occured when quickly clicking on random conversations from the All Connections table within the Enhanced Agent Workspace. This error prevented the table from loading, instead showing an "An Error has occurred" message. This error has been fixed.
