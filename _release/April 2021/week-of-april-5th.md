## [Agent Assist] Fixes to remove bot and replace bot
### Type: Bug fix (Conversation Orchestrator)

* Fixed the issue where the "Remove bot" UI button block was added to all conversations when the bot only joined one of the conversations.
* Fixed the issue where the bot name was missing in the “Remove bot” UI button block.
* Fixed the issue where multiple bots were allowed to join the same conversation. After this fix, only one bot is allowed in a conversation, and the agent must click the “Replace bot” button to switch to another bot.

## [LE UI] Hide self-provisioning from the UI
### Type: Enhancement (LE UI 12.9)

Later this year, the ability to self-provision Twilio numbers will be relaunched in the Management Console. This is the planned long-term approach to supporting self-provisioning. Support for self-provisioning will be phased out of the Campaign Builder / Data Sources area beginning with the feature change described here. Brands needing to provision a number during this change will work with their CSMs to receive the assistance of the SMS Distribution team. Please contact your LivePerson representative for more information. 

## [LE UI] Auto-close feature - new minimal valid value
### Type: Enhancement (LE UI 12.9)

The Auto-close feature has now a new minimal valid value of 10 minutes, instead of 25 minutes. Accounts can now configure the auto-close time to be lower than 25 minutes (but up to 10).

## [LE UI] Agent Manager Permissions Granularity - Allow “Manage” or “Edit only” permissions for Agent Managers
### Type: Enhancement (LE UI 12.9)

Based on user enhancement requests from the field, we added the capability to separate the “Manage” and the “Edit only” permissions per Agent Manager. This allows the administrator to control, per Agent Manager, if this user has “Edit only” permissions, or “Manage” permissions, which also allows them to create new users or to delete existing users. The “Edit only” permissions will allow the user to edit skills, agent groups, profiles and users in groups only.

Turning on this feature will add 6 new Agent Manager permissions, which are “Edit Only” permissions. The change requires enablement, which means that there is no impact on any brand, unless turning this feature is turned ON. 

Please reach out to your LivePerson representative in order to activate this feature.

**Limitations:**

1. The new “Edit only ”permissions are NOT instead of the existing “Manage” permissions, but in addition to them. So the Admin or LP representative will need to turn Off the “Manage” permissions for Agent Managers with “Edit only” permissions.
2. Once this feature is enabled on the backend, When disabling it, the administrator or LP representative will need to turn off the “Edit only” permissions manually in order to go back to allow all Agent Managers the “Manage” permissions.

## JMX Enhancements 
### Type: Enhancements [Agent Matching release 4.6.0]
* **Hide JMX Password:** Encrypt the JMX password so it will be hidden from the code. The JMX password remains the same but hidden and encrypted.
* **Expose Lock Map JMX:** Locking mechanism exists between Routing Kafka consumers and ws traffic. Those locks are held in the inner cache map. Exposing JMX inorder to view those locks in real time. That will be used by our Engineers only.
* **Add JMX for remove from RTT map by conversation Id only:** Following a bug that Agent Manager had regarding stuck tasks in RTT map, A JMX was added in order to manually mitigate and remove those stuck conversations from RTT map if needed.
* **Upgrade kafka-bridge:** Upgrading Kafka bridge to new version to 5.0.0.35-release_1557.
* **Make appD configurable with manifest**:Adding an option to turn on/off appD with server FF instead of deployment. (Note: AppD is disabled by default).

## Update TTR after skill change and transfers & automatic healing of stuck RoutingTaskEvents in RTT map 
### Type: Bug fix [Agent Matching release 4.6.0]
Whenever a transfer to skill or skill change happened, TTR would override to default. This bug fix has now been fixed. 

## Fix Agent state eviction 
### Type: Bug fix [Agent Matching release 4.6.0]
Agent state was evicted from cache after 5 minutes expiration after agent disconnection. Due to multiple agent connections, sometimes agents are disconnected but should have remained connected. Agent state is not reset to default online after 5 minutes of inactivity. This bug has now been fixed.

## Send rings only to subscribed agents 
### Type: Bug fix [Agent Matching release 4.6.0]
There are agents that are connected but not subscribed. AM ACD is sending rings to those agents. Those rings eventually spend time in ‘pending’ state and are not assigned to any agent. Eventually the rings expired and returned to the queue. This bug is here in order to avoid rings to be sent to connected and not subscribed agents and avoiding ‘pending’ time where the ring is not assigned to any agent and not part of the queue.
