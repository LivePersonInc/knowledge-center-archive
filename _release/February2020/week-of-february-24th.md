## [Live chat] Widgets shifting left and covering transcript area

## [Mobile app messaging] Incorrect push notification language when conversation is resumed by the agent
### Type: Bug fix (LE UI 11.6)

For brands using mobile app messaging, localized push notifications in mobile do not work properly when an agent resumes the conversation with the consumer. It has been discovered that once the conversation has been resumed, the language of the push notifications goes back to the default language, instead of maintaining the language setting from the  previous conversation. This bug has been fixed.

## White space displayed on a video card in Internet Explorer 11
### Type: Bug fix (LE UI 11.6)

When a brand working on Internet Explorer 11 sends video cards to consumers a white space has been displayed within the video card on the agent workspace side. This bug only occurs on Internet Explorer 11, and not on any other browser. The bug has been fixed.
