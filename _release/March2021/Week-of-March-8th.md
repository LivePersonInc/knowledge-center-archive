## Assessing the same secure form multiple times
### Type: Enhancement (Secure Forms)
The option to assess the same form multiple times is configurable (specifically for Web). 
Brands can define how many times a consumer will be able to reopen the same secure form prior to submitting it. 
This is useful for brands to allow consumers to broswe back and forth different pages (e.g. collecting customer ID) during the conversation while filling out the secure form while keeping it accessible.In order to configure, please contact your LivePerson account team.

## Return source name in the response 
### Type: Enhancement (Messaging History Interactions API version 1.1.0.61)
The source of the API call, which is sent by the API consumer, will now be returned in the API response. The source name will be mirrored and will be added automatically, in the case of pagination, to the URLs used as reference to the next, previous, first, and last pages in the response.
This will allow brands to add the source name only for the first call, while follow-up calls can be taken directly from the response, and without need to concatenate manually. 

## [Conversation Orchestrator] Routing by authenticated Structured Data Entities (SDEs)
### Type: Enhancement 

Conversation Orchestrator introduces the ability to route by authenticated Structured Data Entities (SDEs) in Dynamic Routing. Some authenticated SDEs are directly available in the interface and can be used to create policies. 
To create policies using other SDEs, the existing process of using LivePerson Functions needs to be continued.
 
Please Note: To start using this feature, SDEs need to be enabled in Conversation Context Service > Structured Data Entities.

## [Enhanced Agent Workspace] Display offline skills in Rollback menu for Rollover accounts
### Type: Enhancement (NAW 1.22)

Conversation Rollover has a feature called “Rollback” which enables a Handler account user to Rollback a conversation to the corresponding Owner account. The Rollback menu today only displays the Online Skills for the Owner account as options for Rollback. This enhancement will display Offline skills as well, so that the Handler agents will have a better understanding of the activity with the Owner account, and their options for Rollback.
