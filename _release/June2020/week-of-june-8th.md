## Private Messages for messaging
### Type: New functionality 

A new capability is now supported in the enhanced Agent Workspace for messaging - the ability to send private messages to all conversation participants, except for the consumer. This capability will enable managers to guide agents during active conversations, while agents will be able to ask managers for directions and clarifications.
Private messages will not affect the conversation’s SLA, intensity (active/inactive status), and it will not reset the auto-close timer. This feature is enabled by default. 

**Limitations**
* Private messages are not available to bot agents at the moment, only to human agents.
* Private messages will not show a notification to the agent near the module icon, or on top of the conversation line in the My Connections panel (unlike regular messages).

The ‘Operational & Staffing for Live Chat’ was enhanced to allow brands to analyze the converted consumers versus the control group and self served visitors groups.

Self service visitors -  Visitors who were exposed to an invite, but did not have any engagement/chat  and converted on the web site ( they might clicked on content but they didn't start a chat)
Control group visitors -  Visitors who were not exposed to any engagement in their site journey either they were in a control group or prospects who aren't exposed to invites.

Previously,  the report  included only Chat group metrics for visitors that end up in interactive chats. In this version we added the following groups.

## Load balancing for messaging - Redistribute the load to connected agent groups
### Type: Enhancement (LE UI 11.9) 

Messaging Advanced load distribution is a routing capability that allows brands to define how the messaging load gets distributed between different agent groups. This kind of capability is a necessity for brands that outsource their messaging operations and must meet clear contractual obligations as to which vendor handles which percentage of the total brand messaging traffic. It allows the brand to define that a specific agent group is correlated with a specific vendor and define, per skill, the way that the load will be distributed between the agent groups.

This phase of the feature looks to address cases where the contact center is offline. The new enhancement is able to automatically apply a new load balancing scheme which is based on the skill load balancing configuration as well as the current online state of the rest of the defined agent groups. The new load balancing will reroute both incoming conversations as well as conversations that are already in the queue and were not yet assigned to a human agent, to the rest of the online contact centers.

In order to prevent contact center attribution issues, conversations that were already assigned to a human agent within one contact center will not get redistributed to other contact centers within the span of a single conversation. Such conversations will remain assigned to the contact center that handled them first.

**Example:**
* Skill A is defined to load balance with the percentages:
  * Contact center 1 - 50% of the load
  * Contact center 2 - 30% of the load
  * Contact center 3 - 20% of the load
* Contact center 1 goes offline at 8 PM while contact centers 2 and 3 go offline an hour later (different time zones)
* At 8PM the new incoming conversations as well as conversations that were waiting for contact center 1 and were not yet assigned to a human agent to be distributed to contact centers 2 and 3 based on the respective ratios:
  * Contact center 1 - offline
  * Contact center 2 - 30/50 = 60% of the load
  * Contact center 3 - 20/50 = 40% of the load
* Once contact center 1 reopens the load will automatically rebalance again

{: .notice}
This feature has backend dependencies. Please contact your LivePerson representative for more information. 

**How to enable:**
A checkbox was added to the Advanced load distribution section in LiveEngage under the skill settings. Once the “Redistribute load when agents are not connected” checkbox is marked, the new enhancement is effective.

## Disable authentication within the Connection Panel
### Type: Bug fix (LE UI 11.9) 

A bug has been found within the Connection panel after an upgrade to the latest UI version, we added the option for users to be authenticated when using the feedback bot, which caused a bug. The bug caused the Connection Panel authentication to stop working for some accounts/users. This means that the accounts can't open new conversations from the connection panel. The bug has been fixed and we reverted the changes, so the feedback bot will only be unauthenticated again when we are able to implement a better solution.

## Distorted info tooltip icon under Edit skill
### Type: Bug fix (LE UI 11.9) 

A visual bug was found and fixed where an info tooltip icon got distorted when working in dark mode. This bug has been resolved.
