## [Enhanced Agent Workspace] All conversations filter enhancement 
### Enhancement (NAW 1.16)

A couple of enhancements were made for the All Conversations filter of the enhanced Agent Workspace, providing users with an improved filtering experience for the following KPIs:
* Duration
* MCS
* Response time

## [Enhanced Agent Workspace] Conversational command results not displayed for conversations joined via 'All Conversations’ 
### Bug fix (NAW 1.16)

A bug has been discovered in the All Conversations list of the enhanced Agent Workspace, causing conversational command results to not be displayed for conversations joined via the 'All Conversations’ tab. This bug has been fixed and the function output is now shown for all relevant conversations.

## [Enhanced Agent Workspace]  Conversational command disappears when using the 'Enter' key to execute it
### Bug fix (NAW 1.16)

## [Enhanced Agent Workspace] All conversations - Spaces between characters not accepted when searching for a skill filter
### Bug fix (NAW 1.16)

A bug has been discovered in the All Conversations list filter of the enhanced Agent Workspace, preventing users from searching for skills containing multiple words. This bug has been fixed and space is now an acceptable character in the skill filter search field.

## Storing permanent variables
### Type: Enhancement (Conversation Builder)
In an upcoming release in October of the Conversation Builder, LivePerson will be removing the "Forever" option for the duration of a variable or a slot.
No change to the Request, Dialog, or Session options will be made.
 
In addition, in the setBotVariable scripting function, we will likewise deprecate support for a value of “true” for the persistForever argument:
setBotVariable(name, value, persistForSession, persistForever).

Bot developers should begin the development work now to update existing implementations to use the Context Session Store for storing data long-term. The Context Session Store allows for setting data in Global, User, and Conversation scopes.
