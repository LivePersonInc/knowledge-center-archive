Some reports come pre-formatted in flat-file tables, such as Messaging and Engagement History, to be easily consumed by your chosen BI solution, making the process of having conversation data scheduled for delivery quick and simple.

Today conversations that are set with a long manual SLA maintain a capacity of 1 (active) until the time to inactive defined by Smart Capacity had passed. Only then the weight of the conversation would go down to its inactive weight. While it makes sense in cases where short manual SLAs are set, in cases where long manual SLAs are set this behavior blocks the agent capacity until the conversation reaches its inactive state. This behavior translates into agent wasted capacity of about 2- 4 min, depending on the brand Smart Capacity configuration.

With the new Capacity management for manual SLA, it is now possible to define a threshold value that in cases where the manual SLA set to the conversation is higher than this value, the conversation capacity would immediately be set to the inactive weight, and by that optimize the agent and brand efficiency.

Additionally, with this new feature, conversations that are set with manual SLA can auto-close, assuming that the manual SLA set to the conversation had expired.

The LiveEngage Meaningful Connection Score™ (MCS) provides an automatic, unbiased method to measure the relationship between consumers and brands and serves as a real-time customer satisfaction metric, an alternative to CSAT.

It can be used by brands for actionable real-time alerts, for agent performance management and coaching, integration with internal BI systems (such as Power BI, Tableau, etc), or for tracking broader brand performance (e.g. for staffing adjustments).

New feature adds a support for the existing MCS for two additional languages - Italian and Japanese.

**How to enable**

Enabled by default. No need to configure anything.

Custom lexicon per account is not supported in Japanese language. Japanese lexicon can only be updated via code change & rollout of the service.

**Available to all customers?** Yes

**Description**

For brands with a bot configured to be the first agent handling each conversation (for example, a routing bot), a new metric as been added to measure the average time conversation are waiting in queue to be assigned.

The new metric ‘avgWaitTimeForAgentAssignment_AfterBotTransfer’ as been added to both Messaging Queue Health and Messaging Current Queue Health methods.

The metric measures the average number of milliseconds a transferred conversation is waiting in the queue (unassigned) for the next agent to be assigned to it. These metrics measure for transfers from bots.

**How to enable**

Added to the existing Messaging Operations API - Messaging Queue Health and Messaging Current Queue Health methods. No additional enablement needed.

Full documentation, including the definition of the newly exposed metric, can be found in the [LivePerson Developers Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-operations-api-methods-messaging-queue-health.html).

**Available to all customers?** Yes

For brands with a bot configured to be the first agent handling each conversation (for example, a routing or greeting bot), the API now provides an easier mechanism to distinguish between BOT results and HUMAN results.

A new parameter as been added to the Messaging Skill Segment method, part of the RT Messaging Operations API, to allow filtering the data in the response by the user type of the participating agent.

The optional parameter ‘userType’ can be added to the request URL with any of the following values:

* userType=human

  The response will be filtered to show segments in which only human agent\\s participated in
* userType=bot

  The response will be filtered to show segments in which only bot\\s participated in
* userType=all

  The response will not be filtered by the user type of the agent. All segments will be included

**How to enable**

Added to the existing Messaging Operations API, Messaging Skill Segments method.

In order to filter the API response by the new parameter, it has to be included in the request URL. Full documentation can be found in the [LivePerson Developers Community](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-operations-api-methods-messaging-skill-segment.html).

## Bug Fixes

### Messaging Queue Health - The metric wait time for Agent Assignment - New Conversation shows null values when using ‘system routing’ feature (LE-99161)

The metric avgWaitTimeForAgentAssignment_NewConversation was fixed to show data also for brands using system routing feature.

The metric now displays the time the conversation waits in queue after it has been routed to the relevant skill by the system.

**How to enable**

Fixed in the existing Messaging Operations API - Messaging Queue Health and Messaging Current Queue Health methods. No additional enablement needed.
