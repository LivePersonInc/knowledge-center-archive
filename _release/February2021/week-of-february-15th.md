## [LE UI] New Instagram connector support in the Conversational Cloud
### Type: New Functionality (LE UI 12.8)

The Conversational Cloud will support the new Instagram connector as a new third-party messaging channel in the data sources. Agents will be able to see all the pages that are currently connected to the respective Instagram handles. Additionally they will be able to subscribe to the new handles and unsubscribe from the existing one’s, making the onboarding of Instagram quick and easy for the brands.

Another advantage that brands will have that the agents would be able to configure the Ice breakers aka conversation starters during the onboarding process. Ice breakers provide a way for the consumers to start a conversation with the business with a list of frequently asked questions. A maximum of 4 questions can be set by the agents during the self-service onboarding process via data sources in the Conversation Cloud.

## [Instagram] Story mentions
### Type: New Functionality 

Instagram allows agents and consumers to post images and videos with Stories. Stories have a slideshow format, and they remain live for a fixed period of 24 hours. This short-lived nature of content drives urgency. Stories enjoy a lot of visibility displayed right under the Instagram logo at the top of follower’s timeline.

Consumers can start conversations with brands in two ways using Stories:
* **Consumers tag the brand in their Story:** Consumers can tag brands in their Story to notify them of any positive feedback, acknowledgement, complaints or any queries to a specific product/service that the brand offers. This will send a notification to the brands where the agents will be able to see the content (image/video) posted by the consumer. **Note: The brand must follow the consumer or the consumer’s profile needs to be public, otherwise no conversation will be opened.**
* **Consumer replies to the brand’s Story:** Brands can market their products to their consumers while they are running a campaign for their products/services,actively engaging consumers over the interactive content that the brand will post. 

**Enablement:** Story mentions are enabled by default. In the event that you don’t want to receive DMs from your consumers via the Story mention entry point, please contact your LIvePerson representative to disable this feature.

The following are known limitations in this release. These are soon to be resolved:

* If you filter the transcripts using a Phrase Search, this returns only the first 10 results.
* If you filter the transcripts using a Phrase Search and then download the returned transcripts, this yields an empty CSV file.
* On the main dashboard, the Intent Match Rate now supports two decimal places. In the next release, this change will also be made to the Overview and Intents views for a bot.
