## Engagement Controller [coming soon]
### Type: New feature 

{: .notice}
This feature is in gradual rollout

The Engagement Controller is a feature within Conversation Orchestrator that enables brands to control the incoming flow of conversations in Web Messaging.

This feature is in addition to the existing Campaign Builder settings. It allows brands to use welcome bots to start conversations and will show or hide Web Messaging engagements based on skill availability. Campaign Builder settings such as enable or disable engagements or Campaign time frame will always have higher priority than Engagement Controller settings.

Users are able to set up rules that contain conditions which check skill availability based on the queue size and the wait time metrics as well as actions to show or hide engagements. Rules can be set up on the campaign or engagement level. Rules on campaign level will affect all engagements in this campaign.
