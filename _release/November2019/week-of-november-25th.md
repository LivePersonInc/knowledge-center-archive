The agent survey for messaging was enhanced with the following new capabilities:
* **Previously submitted surveys** - The agent survey widget will now have a new tab named ‘previously submitted’. This tab will show all surveys that have been submitted for the current conversation. A new permission will be added. If the permission ‘view previously submitted surveys’ is on, the agent will see **all** surveys submitted for the conversation, even by other agents. When the permission is off, the agent will see only surveys submitted by themself.
* **Engagement history widget** - The engagement history widget will now reflect the last submitted agent survey for each conversation
* **All Connections icon (old agent workspace)** - Conversations with pending surveys will have a new icon in the All Connections list, showing the survey is still pending. A pending survey is a survey that has not yet expired and wasn’t submitted.
* **All Connections filtering (Current workspace)** - New filters were added in order to find specific conversations per the following:
  * Survey status (pending/non-pending)
  * Survey name / id
  * Survey questions + answers
* **Closed conversations icon** - Agents will have an indication of conversations that are pending agent survey in their closed conversations section.

**How to enable:**
* Log into LiveEngage
* Go to Engagement studio
* Click on “Additional window settings”
* Expand “Look and feel” section
* Click on the dropdown for “Engagement window border” and select “Yes”
* Click on “Save”

Consumer to agent file sharing is not working on mobile iOS 13 and Safari desktop version 13. When visitors try to share files with an agent, they see an error indicating there was an issue sending it. This was caused by the thumbnail size for the file being too big and eventually dropped the websocket connection. 

**Fix:** In order to circumvent this issue, the thumbnail image is replaced with the generic “Click to View” image. This generic thumbnail image will be used for all supported file types that visitors share with agents. The thumbnail will be presented for both the agent and the consumer.

**Please note:** This is only for the Safari version. All other browsers remain the same.

## Secure form displays with incorrect header and blank screen after conversation is closed

### Type: Bug fix 

If a visitor has filled out a secure form and submitted it to the agent, and then closes the conversation window, reopens the window and clicks on the secure form link in the conversation history, the form will open in a slide out window but the panel will appear bank. This issue has been resolved.

## [Manager workspace] New wait time in queue metric

### Type: New functionality  

In order to have better visibility of the status of the queues, a new “Wait time” metric has been added to the “Queue summary” widget. The metric is available on a skill level (queue) breakdown. 

The metric displays the **90% percentile of the consumers wait time for an agent assignment.** This means that 90% of consumers are currently waiting for an agent assignment for this amount of time or less. The metric is not impacted by the time frame filter, as it is showing the current status of the queue.  

![](img/week-of-november-25th-17.png)

## [Manager workspace] New overdue metric 

### Type: New functionality  

The overdue metric allows managers to closely monitor the number of overdue conversations during the shift and take action when needed. It has been added in two locations: 
* **Queue summary:** This metric displays the number of conversations *assigned to agents* of the groups you manage, which exceeded the target response time.
* **Activity summary:** This metric displays the number of conversations *waiting in queue*, which exceeded the target response time.

The overdue metric is impacted by the relevant filters.

![](img/week-of-november-25th-18.png)

## [Manager workspace] Filter by specific hour 

### Type: New functionality  

Until now, users have been able to change the time range of the manager workspace to view data from the past X hours (maximum supported time range is 24 hours).

With this version, users will also be able to filter the workspace from a specific hour in time, in a range between midnight and the current time. This is most useful for brands wishing to monitor the workspace from the beginning of the business day or the shift. 

![](img/week-of-november-25th-19.png)

## Navigation from enhanced agent workspace to the manager workspace 

### Type: New functionality 

When a user drills down to read the transcript of a specific conversations from the “Conversations widget” in the manager workspace, the user is navigated to the enhanced agent workspace. Today, in order to navigate back to the conversation list, the user has to click on the manager workspace icon in the navigation bar. With this version, in order to make the flow more clear, a new “Back to manager workspace” button has been added to easily help you navigate back to the manager workspace.

{: .notice}  
**Please note:** This functionality is available only to agent managers who are using both the new manager workspace and the enhanced agent workspace.

Once the consumer selects the “Yes” option he will be prompted with the second question. The “No” option will lead the consumer to the end of the survey.
* **Email address question:** The text question: “Please provide your email”. Once the consumer types his email address the bot checks whether the email address is valid. For more information please refer to the “Response to unrecognized user email” section.

## [Enhanced agent workspace] Updated keyboard shortcuts 

In the enhanced agent workspace, some of the agent shortcuts were not working properly for some browsers on specific operating systems. We found that some of the shortcut combinations (e.g. users working with Internet Explorer on Windows) were already in use by the browser or by the operating system. Therefore, we changed the shortcut combinations so that they will be supported for all browsers, in all operating systems.

The new shortcuts are as follows:
* Move to next conversation: Alt + Shift + M
* Deselect conversation: Alt + Shift + U
* Copy as plain text: Alt + Shift + Y
* Return to queue: Alt + Shift + Q
* Transfer conversation: Alt + Shift + R
* Close conversation: Alt + Shift + W
* Accept conversation: Alt + Shift + N
* Takeover conversation: Alt + Shift + O
* Leave conversation: Alt + Shift + I
* Logout from LiveEngage: Alt + Shift + L
* Change status: Alt + Shift + S

This feature enhances the Microsoft Bot Framework connector in sending multiple messages from MS Bot Framework to our connector within one activity.

LiveEngage Messaging provides a new metadata input type (“encodedMetadata”) for passing a base64 encoded metadata on a conversation. The new metadata input type is in addition to the existing conversation metadata input field and is available as of UMS 3.15 version.

Previously, the breadcrumbs of the four configurations step of Bot wizard were not clickable. The only way to navigate from each step was with the buttons below it; back and next. With this enhancement, the user can directly jump back to any step, to check the configuration.
Jumping forward is only blocked in case a step is not completed (empty mandatory fields) but jumping back is still possible by clicking on the breadcrumbs.

With this bugfix for an inactive chat, the system will not only send the warning message but also the closing message will be shown and the chat will be closed as defined in the chatbot configuration. 

## Bot dashboard or listing doesn’t show the updated state
### Type: Bug fix

If the bot is running correctly, even after the interruption, this state is not reflected in the bot status dashboard or listing.

## Watson V2 session expires after 5 minutes causing escalations if user response is delayed
### Type: Bug fix

Watson session expires after 5 minutes. This means if a consumer sends a message after that time, it will be escalated due to an error. 

## Fixing issues during conversation context creation for messaging
### Type: Bug fix

Sometimes the bot is not responding to the welcome message on messaging.
Looking into the logs filtered on the convId from the E2E logs  we noticed the following error:
"Could not create conversation context"
It looks like this happens to a lot of conversations because campaignInfo is undefined in the conversationDetails and when creating the conversationContext this is not expected.
This will be caught and the context is created based on the history API data.

## Cannot start/stop bots from dashboard
### Type: Bug fix
Since white-theme release, the start/stop buttons in the dashboard don’t work anymore. This fix removed that problem.
