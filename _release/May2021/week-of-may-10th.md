## Intent Builder - Generating training phrases for intents
###  Enhancement [Conversation Builder 2021_6.0]

Adding training phrases to an intent can sometimes be a challenge, so in this release, we add a tool to help with this. Within an intent, provide just a single training phrase as the input, and the tool automatically generates additional phrases that are similar in meaning. The suggestions are based on actual utterances by your users.

Generating training phrases is useful when: 
You’re building out a LivePerson or third-party NLU domain that you’ve created from scratch.
You’ve converted a LivePerson (Legacy) domain to the LivePerson NLU engine, and now you need to increase the number of training phrases to meet the LivePerson engine’s minimum requirements.

Note:
To have access to this new tool, Intent Analyzer must be enabled for a domain (any domain) in your account, as the tool makes use of the data that it captures.
If you’ve enabled Intent Analyzer recently, expect the tool’s results to improve over time as more data is captured.
If you're a new customer, expect no results until suggestions can be offered based on utterances by your users. And here again, expect the tool's results to improve over time.

This enhancement is available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

## Set “Manage Groups” field to mandatory in the user profile 
### Type: Enhancement [LEUI 13.0]
#### Available to all customers? This enhancement will be available to all customers, to enable, please contact your LivePerson account team.

Today when Agent Manager users are being created or modified, they are created without being assigned to manage a group, when they should always be assigned to one. As a result, impacted users are not able to see the correct conversation and reporting data in the Conversational Cloud.
With this new enhancement, while creating the new user, it’s mandatory to assign him to a group, without a way to save changes if the user is not assigned to one.
Note - No changes for account with only one group.

## Intent Panel 
### Type: New functionality [Performance Optimizer v1.3]

Type: New Feature 

Available to all customers? This feature is not available for all customers.  In order to access the Intent Panel, the brand must have purchased both Performance Optimizer as well as Intent Manager. 

The new Performance Optimizer Intent Panel creates an intent-focused view answering the question of how effectively an operation resolves its consumers’ intents, the customer experience impact, and provides clear and simple view(s) that prioritize areas of opportunity and provide clear action items to optimize the intent and operational performance.  These views will enable a Performance Optimizer user to understand the intent mix and nature of primary contact drivers into the operation and their evolution over time while identifying intents suitable for automation, increase efficiency and reduce operational expenditure. 

There are 3 primary components to the Intent Panel: 
1- A heatmap graphic that will visually prioritize automation opportunities by intent 
2- Automated text that contextualizes 4E performance by intent performance 
3- Intent classification metrics and graphics 

1- The Intent Panel allows users to view the following metrics within the heatmap by Intent for the LOB(s) selected: 

* Closed Conversations
* Closed Conversations % of Total
* Avg. Conversation Duration
* Agent Responses Per Closed Conversation
* MCS (normalized 1-100)

2- The Intent graphics shows the metrics below for the LOBs selected:
* Intentful Rate
* Classification Rate
* Total Messages
* Intentful Messages
* Classified Messages
* Unclassified Messages

3- The automated Intent Diagnostics section will include text that will contextualize performance and provide specific recommendations to improve performance leveraging intent data. 

### How to enable
The Intent Panel does not require enablement; however Intent Manager must be activated in order to view the data. 
Dependencies
Brands must have purchased and activated Conversational Cloud’s Intent Manager. 

### Limitations
The Performance Optimizer Intent Panel is only visible for brands who have purchased Intent Manager. In addition to having purchased and enabled Intent Analyzer, Performance Optimizer users must also have the relevant permissions (refer to Intent Analyzer enablement guide).

In the event either Intent Analyzer is not enabled or the user does not have permissions, the Intent Panel will display a call to action to enable (can be dismissed until such time as Intent Analyzer is enabled or user has permissions).
