## Agent Assist enhancements 
### Enhancement [Conversation Orchestrator] 

**Channel:** This enhancement is available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

Conversation Orchestrator introduces two new enhancements to Agent Assist.
First, up to to five recommendations can now be made to the agent for a detected intent. Previously, only one recommendation could be made. The maximum number of recommendations is configurable, and the default value is 3.
In the following image, the agent is presented with two recommendations, one for a knowledge base article and the other for a bot.

Second, as before, Agent Assist recommends articles and bots to the agent based on the detected intent of the consumer. However, we’ve taken this one step farther. Now, when Agent Assist makes recommendations, it always does so based on not just the consumer’s intent, but also the conversation’s skill. This means you can map a slice of content to desired skills, and then recommend articles and bots based on the intent detected in the consumer utterance.

**Please note:** During setup, you must assign at least one skill to a knowledge base or bot for it to be used in recommendations. Enablement of the knowledge base or bot, which happens by default, is not enough. This is by design.
All knowledge bases and bots that were previously enabled before the release of this change are automatically mapped to all skills available for the account. You can change these at any time.

**Tip:** Take advantage of this skill-based feature change to facilitate your testing. Create a test skill to use to test Agent Assist before assigning a production skill to the knowledge base or bot.
