Connect to messaging supports the ABC channel. Brands can now set up their IVR deflection to use the ABC channel.

### Limitations
* When a voice call is deflected to the ABC channel, the consumer receives an SMS message with a link to start an ABC chat session. Consumers can tap on the ABC link to start a conversation in the Apple Business Chat window, or they can reply directly in the SMS channel. 
* If the receiving consumer is on an Android phone and taps on the ABC link, then they will be redirected back to SMS to continue the conversation with the brand.

2. Routing conversations from certain channels with critical intents during the busiest months or weeks.
3. Combining multiple complex evaluation criteria to arrive at a logical decision for routing.

**Available actions**
* Logical Operations: AND, OR & NOT
* Mathematical Operations: +, -, *, ^, %, sqrt
* Nested Conditions
* Dates, Times, Days of the week

**Availability:** This is only available to brands that are on v2 of the Context Service. All accounts will gradually be migrated from v1 to v2 by the end of 2021. Migration will be a seamless process that will be performed by the product team and brands don’t need to worry about it. Please talk to your LivePerson account executive if you want to be moved to v2 sooner. The v1 APIs will be deprecated on December 31, 2022. 

### Enablement
The expression editor is available to all brands who have been upgraded to Context Service v2. To use this feature, launch Conversation Orchestrator from the applications menu in the Conversational Cloud and then switch to “Write an expression” when creating a new Dynamic routing policy.
