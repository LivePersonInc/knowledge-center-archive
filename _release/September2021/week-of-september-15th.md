Brands that are using Conversational Builder can send the Reply Buttons using the universal tile and soon also using the “Structured Question” element or the “Button Question” element.

### Enablement

Enabled by default.

### Limitations

- Reply Button messages must contain between 1 and 3 buttons.
- Images that are sent as part of ReplyButtons must be whitelisted.

## Knowledge Base is now KnowledgeAI and features rich analytics

### Type: Enhancement [KnowledgeAI - Release 2021_10.0]

**Channels:** This enhancement is available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

**Availability:** All brands.

### Description

The Knowledge Base application—now called KnowledgeAI—introduces several, exciting changes.

KnowledgeAI’s new home page includes a dashboard of rich, diagnostic analytics. Use the dashboard to get an at-a-glance, holistic understanding of when and how your knowledge content is being used. Also check out the displayed alerts and warnings, which are designed to let you know when to take action.

![](img/week-of-september-15th-9.png)

Your knowledge base listing and management experience has also been updated for enhanced usability and insights. First, your list of knowledge bases now comes in two forms: There’s the usual list layout, but now there’s also a handy card layout. You can toggle between these views easily and use whichever you prefer.

![](img/week-of-september-15th-10.png)
![](img/week-of-september-15th-11.png)

Second, as you click into each knowledge base, you’ll find that each has its own dashboard of rich, diagnostic analytics, so you can review knowledge base performance individually.

Finally, there’s a new Answer Tester tool. This tool is similar to the previous Question Tester tool that was available within a knowledge base. The difference is that you can now test questions and and answers at the account-level, i.e., across your knowledge bases too.

## Enhancements to post-conversation survey bots

### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Builder - Release 2021_10.0]

**Channels:** This enhancement is available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

**Availability:** All brands.

### Description

You asked, so we are delivering! In this release, we introduce a host of enhancements to post-conversation bots that have been requested by you:

- Customize the survey bot’s consumer-facing name and picture
- Target surveys to conversations with minimum activity thresholds
- Connect survey bots to skills more easily
- Reporting: New survey outcomes on the Survey Dashboard for Messaging
- Survey expired messages
- New warning when removing Evaluate Options match conditions

**Customize the survey bot’s consumer-facing name and picture**
On the Account Details page in Bot Accounts, you’ll find new controls for customizing the name (full name and nickname) and picture URL of the survey bot.

**Target surveys to conversations with minimum activity thresholds**
Sending surveys to your consumers who aren’t interacting with your brand can negatively impact your CSAT score without cause. For this reason, we’ve added an account-level setting that lets you send surveys only to engaged consumers. Turn the setting on, and then specify the minimum number of messages that must be sent by the bot/human agent and by the consumer for the survey to be triggered. This is all done on the Account Details page in Bot Accounts.

If desired, you can also override these settings at the bot level. This is done in the bot’s Bot Settings.

**Connect survey bots to skills more easily**
Now, when selecting the skill(s) that will trigger the survey bot, you can use the available controls to sort and filter the skills and to search for a skill. This makes things easier when you have a lot of skills from which to select.

**Reporting: New survey outcomes on the Survey Dashboard for Messaging**
The following expanded list of survey outcomes are now reported on the predefined [Survey Dashboard for Messaging:](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-messaging-messaging-dashboards-survey-dashboard-for-messaging.html).

- **Ignored**: The consumer was sent a survey but didn’t respond.
- **Completed**: The survey reached the end of the configured flow.
- **Partially completed** - timed out: The consumer answered some questions, then abandoned the survey.
- **Closed by consumer:** The consumer closed the survey conversation.
- **Unrecognized consumer message**: The bot repeatedly didn’t understand the consumer’s message, repeatedly sent a fallback response, hit the max number of fallback responses, and closed the survey as a result.
- **Not supported**: The consumer’s device didn’t support the survey flow (SDK is incompatible).

**Proactive session expired messages**
Proactively notify consumers when a survey has expired. Previously, during the survey conversation, the bot only sent a “session expired” message in response to the consumer sending a message after the session had expired. Now, as of this release, the “session expired” message is proactively sent as soon as the session expires. The conversation is then closed.

Use the bot-level **Session Expired Message** setting to customize the message to send before closing the conversation (e.g., inform a consumer that a survey has expired). This setting is unique to post-conversation survey bots and not available to other Conversation Builder bots.

**New warning when removing Evaluate Options match conditions**
By default, survey interactions are configured to use Evaluate Options match conditions. This type of match condition determines whether the consumer’s answer choice matches the answer choice specified in the match condition, and, if it does, the Next Action is triggered.

Using Evaluate Options match conditions to trigger Next Actions is recommended to ensure proper recognition of the consumer’s response by the bot. From time to time, we’ve heard from folk who have accidentally removed these match conditions, breaking their survey automation. Therefore, as a help, we’ve added a warning if you try to remove one of these match conditions: _If you delete this option, add patterns or a RegEx expression that accounts for all possible consumer responses. Are you sure you want to delete?_

## Prebuilt domains now available in additional languages

## Support Watson disambiguation response

![](img/RN-sept-7-1.png)

## Block PublicAPI usage of bot agents 

### Type: Enhancement [Bot Connectors 2.34]

**Availability:** All brands.

### Description:
With this feature any login requests to the PublicAPI endpoint which are using the same credentials as the bots configured and running via the ThirdPartyBots platform will be blocked. This is made to ensure the running bots will not be kicked out from within LivePersons Conversational Cloud since it only allows one concurrent agent session at time.

## Allow Invocation of LivePerson Functions in the conversation tester

**Availability:** All brands.

New validations were added. This enables the bots to respond with Function Invocation actions on all vendors in the Conversation Tester.

![](img/RN-sept-7-2.png)

## Show up-to-date agent details instead of original data 

### Type: Fixes [Bot Connectors 2.34]

**Availability:** All brands.

### Description:
Thus far, information about the bot agent was stored directly in LivePerson's Database. Because of this we showed e.g. the original skill assignment even if the skills assigned to the bot agent were changed. With this fix, only the agent identifier will be stored and will always show up to date information fetched from ac-users.
