### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Orchestrator]

**Availability:** All brands

### Description
Dynamic Routing enables intelligent routing of conversations to the most qualified agents -- bot or human -- based on intent and other contextual data, such as: consumer inputs, past interactions, loyalty tier, and other attributes. Dynamic routing makes highly personal consumer journeys possible at scale. It is a key application within LivePerson’s Conversational AI product suites.

We’re super excited to announce a new code-free experience that will make intelligent routing effortless. This bot is a true powerhouse, as it significantly simplifies Dynamic Routing. Here are some major enhancements:

* Use the **new Dynamic** Routing bot to set up and deploy Dynamic Routing within minutes
* Place the **new Dynamic Routing interaction** anywhere in any bot to enable Dynamic Routing
* Create and manage routing policies including fallbacks and failures with minimal effort
* Enable routing by channel and intent out-of-the-box, and combine it with other data like structured data entities (SDEs) or context variables to create personalized journeys



### How to enable
