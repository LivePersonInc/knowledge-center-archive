## More flexibility when sending post-conversation surveys
### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Builder Release 2021_7.0]

In a previous release, we added support for an account-level Survey Request Interval setting, so you can control how often a consumer is sent a post-conversation survey when one is triggered. In this release, we enhance the setting to give you more flexibility.

As an example, assume you have surveys A, B and C, and you enable this setting with a value of 20 days:

As before, you can apply the setting to all bots collectively, i.e., at the account level. So, if the consumer receives survey A, they will not receive survey A again, or receive surveys B and C, until 20 days have passed.
However, now, you can also choose to apply the setting to each bot individually, i.e., at the survey bot level. In this case, if the consumer receives survey A, they will not receive survey A again until 20 days have passed. During this time, they still might receive surveys B and C.

Tip: You enable the Survey Request Interval setting in the Bot Accounts application.

## LivePerson NLU engine supports Spanish 
### Type: Enhancement [Intent Builder Release 2021_7.0]

This enhancement is available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

In this release, LivePerson broadens the language support for its LivePerson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine: Spanish is now a supported language.

## AI Annotator - Increase number of AI Tasks max exported rows to 50,000 (AE-17682)
### Type: Enhancement [NAW version 1.28]
As customers continuously adopt AI Annotator, more and more annotations are created. Since in many cases, bot tuning activities are managed through a spreadsheet, LivePerson needs to provide the ability to download more rows than is now possible (5,000) when exporting submitted annotations. 

## Enhanced Agent Workspace - Prevent Transfers within the same skill (AE-17568)
### Type: Enhancement [NAW version 1.28]

To prevent abusing the system and provide a better customer experience, the ability to prevent transfers within the same skillis is now supported in the enhanced agent workspace for messaging.
Accounts with this feature On, will have the following behavior while transferring conversations:
1.  When transferring by skill - The destination skills list wouldn't contain the conversation skill.
2.  When transferring by agent - 
a) The conversation skill cannot be transferred to any other skills - The destination agents list would be empty.
b)  The skill can transfer to all skills - The destination agents list would contain only agents without skills assigned to them or that have at least 1 skill different than the conversation skill assigned to them.
c) The skill can transfer only to specific skills - the destination agents list would contain only agents that have at least 1 skill from the allowed skills list, that is different from the conversation skill, assigned to them.
