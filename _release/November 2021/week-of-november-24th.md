#### Availability:
All brands.

#### Description:
v2.7.8 brings a refreshed UI to both the phone and tablet versions of Agent App. All sections have received a clean up allowing for a more pleasing interface, but more importantly weâ€™ve added a tab bar at the bottom of the phone version which allows manager functionality, User Manager and now Manager Workspace (see below), to now be available on phone.

There are three tabs in total: Agent Workspace, Manager Workspace, and User Manager. These will be shown depending on what roles and permissions the user has.
