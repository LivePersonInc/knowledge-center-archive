Additionally, Conversation Assist’s new home page includes a dashboard of rich, diagnostic analytics. Use the dashboard to get an at-a-glance, holistic understanding of when and how recommendations are offered and used.

Finally, we’ve redesigned the UI to make it more intuitive: View your knowledge bases and bots on two different tabs of the new Recommendation Sources page. From there you can easily turn these sources on and off and assign skills to them.

Find settings that impact all your recommendation sources on a redesigned Settings page. Use this page to:

* Temporarily suspend all recommendations if you need to.
* Configure the maximum number of recommendations to serve at one time.
* Set the minimum scores that answers and bots should have for them to be offered as recommendations.
* Customize the messages sent to the consumer when a bot is added to and removed from a conversation.
