## Support for resolving stuck conversations
### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Builder 11.0]
**Channels**: Available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

#### Availability 
All brands. 

#### Description
In this release of Conversation Builder, LivePerson adds support for resolving stuck conversations. This helps bots to re-engage the consumer when the conversation isn’t progressing as expected.

**Retrying the consumer’s last message**
In a conversation, when the bot fails to respond to the consumer within 60 seconds, the consumer’s last message can be resent to the bot one or more times. You can configure the timeout interval and the number of retries. This “retry” flow is existing functionality that has not changed.

Once the retry flow is fully completed, if the bot still fails to respond to the consumer, the conversation is identified as “stuck.”

**Resolving stuck conversations**
In this release, we introduce a few ways to resolve stuck conversations. Now, you can resolve them by:
1. **Asking the consumer to resend their original query.** If you configure this, the conversation starts anew, and the consumer is sent, “I’m sorry. Something went wrong, so let’s start fresh. Could you restate your question in a few words?” You can customize the message.
2. **Transferring the conversation to a human agent.** To add support for this, you must specify the human agent skill ID that can better assist the consumer.

#### Enablement
You must manually add support for this flow. You can add just Step 1 or both Steps 1 and 2. You cannot add Step 2 alone. If you configure both steps, they are tried in the order above.

**Note:** For an optimal consumer experience, LivePerson recommends that you configure both steps.
For more information, including details on how to add support, see the discussion on resolving stuck conversations in the Best Practices section of the Conversation Builder documentation in the [Developer Center](https://developers.liveperson.com).

## Comments to interactions
### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Builder 11.0]
**Channels**: Available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

#### Availability 
All brands. 

#### Description
You can now add comments to an interaction to annotate your solution, i.e., to describe what the interaction is for, what it does, and what it needs.

![](img/week-of-november-3rd-2021-5.png)

Use comments to quickly explain things. They are particularly helpful when you work in a collaborative context that includes multiple bot builders, and when the person maintaining the bot isn’t the one who built it originally. In a comment, a maximum of 240 characters are allowed. HTML tags are not allowed.


## Bot Analytics unveils new metrics for containment, disengagement and transfers
### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Builder - Bot Analytics 11.0]
**Channels**: Available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

#### Availability 
All brands. 

#### Description
Bot Analytics now includes several new metrics that help you assess the success or failure of your bot conversations. You can use the new metrics to review transcripts more efficiently, so you can quickly move to bot tuning where needed.

**Note:** These new metrics are hidden by default. To show these metrics, please contact your LivePerson representative, so they can make this configuration change.

The new metrics include:
* **Bot disengaged**: This metric is the number of conversations where the consumer was left hanging past the bot session timeout because the bot never responded to their last message.
* **Consumer disengaged**: This metric is the number of conversations where the bot was left hanging past the bot session timeout because the consumer never responded to its last message.
* **Intended transfer**: This metric is the number of conversations transferred from the bot to a human agent as designed, i.e., via an Agent Transfer interaction or a LivePerson Agent Escalation integration. For example, you might want to transfer to a human agent for the purpose of collecting credit card information from the consumer. Intended transfers can be used to identify missed opportunities for automation.
* **Unintended transfer**: This metric is the number of conversations transferred from the bot to a human agent due to an automatic escalation. If this metric is high, evaluate whether the bot was equipped with all the resources needed to satisfy the consumer’s intent.
* **Bot contained**: This metric is the number of conversations that were received and handled by the bot, where the conversation was never transferred to a human agent, and where neither the bot nor the consumer disengaged.

For quick, high-level insight into where things aren’t working, the Bot disengaged and Consumer disengaged metrics have been added to the account-level dashboard. 

Find all the new metrics on the bot-level Overview page:
![](img/week-of-november-3rd-2021-6.png)

Finally, we’ve likewise incorporated the new metrics into a Conversations page. This page is new in this release. It displays conversation status data for a specified date range.

![](img/week-of-november-3rd-2021-7.png)

On the Conversations page, use the Date filter and Metrics filter to identify a date range to examine more closely. Then, in the table below, select a link to display a list of conversations with a given conversation status, such as “Bot Disengaged,” on a given date.

On the resulting page, you can then click a conversation ID link to view the transcript.

![](img/week-of-november-3rd-2021-8.png)

Overall, take advantage of the new metrics to perform a targeted review—not a random review—of bot conversation transcripts. This makes it faster and easier to identify opportunities for bot tuning.

## Intent Manager introduces a Commerce: Purchase Product domain
### Type: Enhancement [Conversation Builder - Intent Manager 11.0]

**Channels**: Available for all channels supported by the Conversational Cloud platform.

#### Availability 
All brands. 

#### Description
Getting started with Conversational Commerce (cCommerce) just got much easier! Intent Manager introduces a new Commerce: Purchase Product prebuilt domain. Like all other prebuilt domains, this domain is ready-made and pre-trained. 

This is a new type of prebuilt domain. Domains like Telecommunications and Financial Services are intended for a specific vertical and designed for coverage, meaning the model covers most of the intents that your customers might express. In contrast, the Purchase Product domain covers a specific set of intents related to product search and information, order management, and product shipping, with much greater precision and accuracy than was possible previously. When the model captures an intent, it has a very high reliability that it got it right, reducing the risk of false positives. Precision as high as 0.92 (out of 1.0).

The Commerce: Purchase Product domain includes intents such as:

* Search for product
* Return product
* Request product size
* Check order status
* Check shipping availability

The Purchase Product domain isn’t limited to a specific vertical; if your business needs support for intents like these, you can take advantage of this domain to get up and running quickly with cCommerce intents. The domain can supplement the other domains in your solution that cover care and vertical-specific intents (using the recently released multi-domain functionality), or the new intents and training phases can be added to an existing domain. It is also supported for use as a starter pack, which involves selecting training phrases from your own messaging for even greater precision.
